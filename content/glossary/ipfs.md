The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer network for storing files, and the system of choice for NFTs to store metadata and images. One of the signature features of IPFS is "[content addressing](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/)," where URLs are unique, based on the contents of the file, providing user's certainty that the file they are accessing is verified and cannot be changed.
