The primary tool for accessing assets on a blockchain, a wallet is a piece of software of hardware that stores a user's credentials (public/private cryptographic keys). It is important to note that a wallet does not store the assets itself, rather it proves ownership of items that are stored on the blockchain (e.g., cryptocurrencies, NFTs).
