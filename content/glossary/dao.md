A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an entity where member token holders share the ability to govern, and participate in collective decision making. Proposals and their corresponding votes are posted on the blockchain, and typically viewable my members and non-members alike, allowing for non-heirarchical and transparent governance.
