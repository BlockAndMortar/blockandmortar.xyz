title: Things Go Wrong™

Cryptocurrency is a blend of money and software.   The same code bugs that lead to app crashes and hacker exploits can make money disappear. 

The Aku Dreams project recently saw $34M worth of tokens "bricked," or made inaccessible, due to a flaw in a smart contract's code. (We first saw this on the [@0xInuarashi Twitter account](https://twitter.com/0xInuarashi/status/1517674505975394304), which went deep into technical detail. For a higher-level overview, check out this [article on PYMNTS](https://www.pymnts.com/blockchain/2022/akus-nightmare-34m-locked-forever-as-flaw-highlights-danger-of-smart-contracts/).)

It's easy to rip on crypto because money can get locked up like this.  Let's not forget how the traditional banking sector has experienced its own trials over the past, oh, couple hundred years. And there are _still_ issues. Just ask anyone who has mistakenly wired money into the wrong account. 

Similar to the trading industry, crypto is a space where code flaws are unforgiving. It pays to hire experienced talent and support them with robust testing and a solid risk management function. The old belt-and-suspenders approach. 

Given the high cost of failure, we wonder: when will smart contracts go the way of concurrent programming or encryption, in which developers are strongly discouraged from rolling their own from scratch? Far better to extend frameworks that have been built by experts and thoroughly road-tested for edge cases.
