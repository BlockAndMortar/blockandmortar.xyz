Where there's money, there's crime. And where theft can be difficult to reverse, expect more crime. Crypto involves lots of money that is hard to reverse, so you can see where we're going here. 

This week [hackers compromised the official Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) Instagram account and Discord server](https://watcher.guru/news/bayc-instagram-and-discord-hacked-over-13-million-in-nfts-stolen). They used this access to send fraudulent links to BAYC NFT holders, who unwittingly gave up their digital possessions when they clicked through. 

It's practically a rite of passage to be scammed out of your crypto tokens or NFTs. Such thefts often involve carefully crafted phishing e-mails or Twitter DMs from lookalike accounts.  While BAYC holders are frequent targets of scams, this one feels particularly sneaky because users don't expect to be ripped off by someone [speaking through official channels](https://twitter.com/BoredApeYC/status/1518637579633053701). It would be like, say, big tech companies relinquishing user data to people who had [hijacked police department e-mail accounts](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/30/23003600/apple-meta-shared-data-hackers-pretending-law-enforcement-officials). Not that this has ever happened…  

Still, the laws are catching up to this new reality. The state of New York wants to formally [declare certain types of crypto crime – notably, rug pulls – illegal](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/143193/state-lawmakers-want-to-make-fraudulent-rug-pulls-a-crime-in-new-york). This may not seem like much, but laws (ones that are properly enforced, at least) have a way of building trust in a system. And trust leads to increased adoption.
