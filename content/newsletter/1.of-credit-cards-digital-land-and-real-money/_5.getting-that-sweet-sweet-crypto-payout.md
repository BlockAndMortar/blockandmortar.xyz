title: Getting that sweet sweet crypto payout
---
Pro athletes are increasingly [taking some or all of their compensation in cryptocurrency](https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-major-sports-are-paying-athletes-in-crypto).  Since token prices can fall, skeptics may see this as a needlessly risky way to get paid. Why not stick with cold, hard cash?

Try to replace _"paid in crypto"_ with _"paid in stock options"_ and ask how you feel. In both cases, a person takes some amount of comp in an asset that they hope will increase in value.  

One key difference is that an employee paid in company stock can work harder to keep the share price high. (Some roles have more influence than others, but you know what we mean.)  But since celebrities can have an outsized impact on a token's price, a sufficiently famous athlete can tie their on-field performance to the value of their payout. Maybe it's not so different, after all?
