title: Credit where it's DAO
---
A Distributed Autonomous Organization, or DAO, is an interesting web3 concept: a group of people, most of whom are strangers to one another, develop a pool of funds and adopt a governance structure to guide their operations and investments. The DAO can serve a variety of purposes, such as [(attempt to) buy the US Constitution](https://www.theverge.com/22820563/constitution-meme-47-million-crypto-crowdfunding-blockchain-ethereum-constitution), [manage a portfolio of NFT investments](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/10/flamingodaos-nft-portfolio-is-now-worth-1b/), or [help creators better connect with their audience](https://cointelegraph.com/news/irenedao-nfts-causing-a-stir-on-crypto-twitter). 

For all that it can accomplish, a DAO is not a formally incorporated business.  (Nor is it completely off the books.  Some US state laws recognize them as "unincorporated associations" ... but that's a story for another day.) It therefore doesn't get access to traditional banking services. Payments startup Rain aims to fill that gap by [offering corporate credit cards to DAOs](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/143717/web3-startup-rain-raises-6-million-to-launch-corporate-credit-cards-for-daos).  Being able to tackle business purchases directly will be much cleaner than juggling reimbursements to individual DAO members. 

We here at Block & Mortar HQ are especially interested in the role of DAOs as business entities.  So we look forward to seeing more services bridge web3 to traditional business infrastructure.
