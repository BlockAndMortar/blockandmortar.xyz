title: Having your crypto and spending it, too

But what do you _do_ when you've amassed a mountain of cryptocurrency?  Sure, you can trade in your tokens for cash. You can also hold onto the assets and use them as collateral for a loan.  

Florida startup [Milo Credit will issue you a 30-year mortgage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-27/buying-real-estate-with-crypto-new-mortgages-are-backed-by-coins) so long as you hold enough crypto to cover the cost of the home.  This makes sense to us: someone approaching Milo is essentially saying, _"I have enough to buy this place outright. But I'd like to spread out the payments over the long-term."_  What better way to demonstrate that you can afford a property by effectively fronting the entire purchase price?

That said, one part of the Milo story really stands out.  According to that Bloomberg article:

> Milo wants to make such loans a big business by pooling them and selling them to banks, asset managers and insurance companies, maybe even offering them as bonds in a securitization, according to founder Josip Rupena.

Is anyone else getting some serious "run-up to 2008" vibes here...?  Oh wait, yes.  [It's not just us](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-04-27/mortgages-backed-by-bitcoin-crypto-what-could-go-wrong). 

Still, it's unfair to assume that mortgage-backed securities would rehash their role as one of the horsemen of financial apocalypse.  Maybe.  Time will tell.
