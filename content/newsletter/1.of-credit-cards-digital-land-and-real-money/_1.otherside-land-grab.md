title: Otherside land grab
---
The company Yuga Labs, best known for the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, has broken ground on its metaverse offering.  (Did you catch that  [slick announcement video from March](https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1505014986556551172)? The one with a rather fitting tune from The Doors as its soundtrack? That only gave a hint as to what was coming.)

Similar to other metaverse setups, Otherside is divided into plots of virtual land with NFTs as deeds.  As each of the 55,000 plots runs a cool $6,000, Yuga Labs will [net more than $300 million in initial sales](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/metaverse-investing-bored-ape-yacht-club-yuga-labs-virtual-land-2022-4).  

The lead-up to Otherside's unveiling saw [large price swings in the underlying ApeCoin token](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-apecoin-fell-34-in-just-hours-ahead-of-saturdays-otherside-mint) that would be used for purchasing (well, "minting") the NFT deeds. Anticipation about the metaverse project sent prices sky-high, while updates from Yuga Labs about the auction rules brought them back down. The world of cryptocurrencies can be an introduction to the harsh realities of market dynamics and variable-priced assets. As the saying goes: "buy the rumor and sell the news."

(The Otherside unveiling also caused some upset on the underlying Ethereum blockchain over the weekend.  We'll cover that in more detail next week.)

Price movements aside, writing deeds to a blockchain sounds useful. What will the real estate market be able to borrow from this idea?

Also, will Otherside pipe in more classic rock tunes throughout its metaverse? Or maybe some [songs from this guy](https://twitter.com/songadaymann/status/1520485229223456768)? If so, we're in.
