title: Swoosh, there it is

Have a quick palate-cleanser before we move on to the FTX side of the story.

The fashion industry was an early adopter of web3 and continues to explore the space. Accepting cryptocurrency for purchases. Developing NFT collections based on their creations. [Using NFTs as event tickets](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/nfts-sight-sound-and-smells#nftickets) and digital twins of physical goods. Even [setting up shop in Minecraft](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/well-that-escalated-quickly#making-the-world-a-little-more-pixelated).

This isn't just the big-name fashion houses, either.  Footwear titan Nike has been on an absolute tear in web3, acquiring companies (such as [rtfkt](https://about.nike.com/en/newsroom/releases/nike-acquires-rtfkt)) and partnering with artists, leading to [more than $185 million in NFT sales alone](https://www.gearpatrol.com/style/a40968155/nike-tiffany-gucci-nft-earnings/).

Most recently, [Nike's web3 work has culminated in the launch of the .Swoosh NFT platform](https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/nike-unveils-dot-swoosh-platform-to-house-web3-projects):

> *The platform will be a place for people to buy, show off and trade phygital and virtual products; unlock access to events and products; and co-create products, says \[Nike VP Ron\] Faris, whose role is to lead Nike’s blockchain, Web3 and metaverse strategies. “When you think of a virtual product like a virtual shoe, it’s not just a shoe; it’s the product and the experience, service or utility baked in.” For example, a virtual shoe might enable holders to preorder a physical counterpart, enable token-gated chats with shoe designers or unlock wearability in a favourite game. “We don't see that virtual product as the end of the purchase journey; it is the beginning of the journey,” Faris says.*

I think it's worth reading that excerpt a few times to appreciate the full scope of what Nike is doing. For example, co-creation of products turns participants into partners, which improves their relationship with the company and with their peers on the platform. And the ability to trade means that participants will have true ownership of their digital goods.

All of this is a sign that Nike really gets what web3 is about. This is not a company doing NFTs for the sake of doing NFTs; Nike is creating an *experience* to drive interest and customer loyalty, and doing so in a way that aligns with consumers' expectations of web3.

Even better, Nike is using .Swoosh to bring more people into the fold:

> *Now, with Dot Swoosh, Nike wants to broaden the net of who its Web3 strategy is for, going beyond Rtfkt’s endemic customer base and tapping into its own, who may be less experienced in the world of Web3. The goal is to educate and onboard the Nike community, rather than the Web3 natives, to “level the playing field”, Faris says.*

Sounds like Nike is playing the long game. I can't wait to see what comes next.
