title: People still have faith in blockchain

Quick palate-cleanser number two:

Between the wider Crypto Winter and the FTX debacle, it's good to see that the world hasn't completely lost faith in web3 technology. In fact, [some large financial institutions are making big plans with it](https://thedefiant.io/as-skeptics-dance-on-cryptos-grave-the-fed-and-big-banks-launch-digital-ledger-project):

> *On Tuesday, a lineup of top-shelf firms — Citigroup, HSBC, Wells Fargo, and MasterCard, among others — joined forces with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to explore using distributed ledgers to connect deposits.*

The [New York Fed's website describes the project in more detail](https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/nyic/facilitating-wholesale-digital-asset-settlement):

> *In a 12-week proof-of-concept project—the Regulated Liability Network U.S. Pilot—\[the New York Innovation Center (NYIC)\] will experiment with the concept of a regulated liability network (RLN). RLN is a concept for a financial market infrastructure (FMI) facilitating digital asset transactions that connect deposits held at regulated financial institutions using distributed ledger technology.*

In light of recent events in crypto, I have to say that I find the RLN blockchain … refreshingly practical? It's not about creating ~~toxic financial powderkegs~~ [high-yield investment vehicles](https://www.epsilontheory.com/the-macguffin-part-2-the-story-arc-of-sbf-and-ftx/) and custom tokens. It's about big banks testing new ways to exchange information.

There's a general thought that once the older crowd – defined as "anyone older than you" – starts hanging out somewhere, it's no longer exciting. It becomes a place for people who have responsibilities and who need to go to bed at a sensible hour. So yes, the RLN project could be seen as the arrival of The Olds to blockchain.

Works for me. I'd really, really like to put the Things Go Wrong™ segment back on the shelf for a while.
