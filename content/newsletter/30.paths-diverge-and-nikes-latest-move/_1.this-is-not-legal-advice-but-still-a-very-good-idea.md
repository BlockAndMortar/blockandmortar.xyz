title: This is not legal advice (but still a very good idea)

It's time for Choose Your Own Adventure, FTX edition.

Your business has just gone up in smoke and a lot of money is missing. Like, *a lot* of money. Creditors are already just a wee bit upset with you, and then it surfaces that you [cashed out $300M from the company](https://www.theblock.co/post/188526/bankman-fried-cashed-out-300-million-during-ftx-fundraise-last-year-wsj) before things went pear-shaped. Two countries are claiming first dibs on putting you behind bars. What would you do?

1.  Chill in your $40M penthouse in the Bahamas.
    
2.  ~~Go on the run~~ Take a little time away for self-reflection.
    
3.  Lawyer up.
    

Like the poet Sean Carter, "[I ain't passed the bar but I know a little bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ap5PUk6jWA&t=108)." So, me, I'm sold on option 3. Anything you say can and will be used against you.  An attorney would tell you to keep quiet. 

I guess Sam missed this advice when [shuffling his legal counsel](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.semafor.com/article/11/17/2022/sam-bankman-fried-parts-ways-with-paul-weiss-lawyers&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669045585580724&usg=AOvVaw0jZBrzmg0iQD55RNdUz30-)? I say this because … [he keeps … tweeting](https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1592567502911205377). And texting with journalists. Then [tweeting some more, to express disappointment](https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1593014934207881218) that [this same journalist has published what he's said](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23462333/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-cryptocurrency-effective-altruism-crypto-bahamas-philanthropy). (Perhaps in the delirium of losing several billion dollars of other people's money, he assumed this was a social call? I don't know.)

I bet it's hard to stay quiet when some very well-known and well-respected media outlets are [publishing glowing reviews of you](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/technology/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-crypto-bankruptcy.html). And when folks are saying [they'd consider backing you on your next go-round](https://www.theblock.co/post/187490/kevin-oleary-would-back-sam-bankman-fried-again-if-he-had-a-new-venture). But, when the nicest thing your previous employer can say about you is that you "[have no ongoing role](https://twitter.com/FTX_Official/status/1592985707819462657)" at the company, take it as a freebie hint:

The best time to speak through legal counsel was about three weeks ago. The second-best time is right now.

As an attorney once so eloquently explained to me: *it's hard to misquote silence.*
