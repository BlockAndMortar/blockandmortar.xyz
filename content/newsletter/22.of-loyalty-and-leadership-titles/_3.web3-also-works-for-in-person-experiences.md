title: web3 also works for in-person experiences

In today's third example of companies blending the digital and physical worlds, [Universal Studios is running a scavenger hunt that will issue NFTs for participation](https://www.theblock.co/post/171491/moonpay-universal-create-an-in-person-nft-based-scavenger-hunt-with-more-than-6-million-tokens).  Unlike the Chipotle Guajillo Steak experience, which ran inside a metaverse property, this Universal event takes place in the real-world Universal Studios theme parks.

Similar to the Starbucks Odyssey program, Universal (through its web3 partner, Moonpay) will handle all of the wallet mechanics behind the scenes:

> _Park guests won’t require advanced crypto knowledge — or even knowing how to set up a crypto wallet — to claim these NFTs. “It's just basically a claim page where you put in your email address, and boom, what we do in the background is we mint that NFT, we spin up a wallet for that particular person and then they're able to claim it when they're ready,” \[Moonpay CEO Ivan\] Soto-Wright said._ 

A lot of what we've said about the Starbucks and Chipotle programs also applies to the Universal scavenger hunt, so we won't repeat that here.  We'll just wrap up this thread with a reminder that web3 is showing real promise for loyalty programs.  You can mix in-person and metaverse activities to create interactive experiences, and handle the underlying mechanics with a well-chosen blockchain.
