Food chain Chipotle is also ramping up its web3 loyalty efforts.  The company has unveiled the new Garlic Guajillo Steak … inside its Roblox metaverse property.  Participants can practice grilling and seasoning steak, in a simulated kitchen, under the tutelage of Chipotle's head chef.

[The prize was more than just virtual points](https://www.nrn.com/fast-casual/chipotle-mexican-grill-debuts-menu-item-metaverse-first-time), however:

> _Chipotle is also giving users who successfully cook and taste Garlic Guajillo Steak a chance to try the new menu innovation in real life. On September 13 and 14, Chipotle will drop 25,000 codes for free entrées at 7 a.m. PT and 3 p.m. PT — a total of 100,000 codes. The codes can only be accessed by Chipotle Rewards members in the U.S. and Canada on the Chipotle app,_ [_Chipotle.com_](http://Chipotle.com) _and_ [_Chipotle.ca_](http://Chipotle.ca)_._
> 
> _Rewards members and Roblox players will get early access to the new entrée._

Similar to the Starbucks program noted above, Chipotle is using its web3 presence for more than just a purely transactional loyalty program.  They've taken the time to create an engaging, interactive experience that gets their true fans to self-identify. Compare this to the web2 marketing approach – trying to contact specific individuals in the hopes of converting them with a semi-tailored message –  and you'll see why the web3 version is so much stronger.

(Also of note: that simulated steak-grilling experience? Don't laugh.  Treat it as a reminder that a corporate metaverse can double as a training center. Maybe Chipotle is using these public games to test-drive future such programs …)

Granted, creating and managing an online game sounds much more involved than your typical marketing effort.  Even if your data scientists have crunched through years' worth of customer transactions to build a suitable analysis, that's still a very different animal than developing an interactive app that has to run 24/7.  We'd love to know what percentage of Chipotle's marketing spend is allocated to technology, and what are the returns compared to their traditional marketing efforts.  If you work there and you're authorized to share that kind of detail, please [hit us up](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/contact)!
