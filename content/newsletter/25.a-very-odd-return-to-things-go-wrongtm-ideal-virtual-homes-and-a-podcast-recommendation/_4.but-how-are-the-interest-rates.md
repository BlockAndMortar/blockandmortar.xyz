title: But how are the interest rates?
---
In newsletter #18 we noted that [the big metaverse players – Roblox, Fortnite, The Sandbox, and so on – are each sorting out the role they want to play](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/metaverse-dive-bars-edible-adverts-and-a-little-ai#so-which-one-will-be-known-as-the-dive-bar).  And one important outcome of that would be:

> **_Other niches or roles will certainly shake out over time._** _The larger, established players will genuinely miss some (cue The Innovator's Dilemma) and they'll pretend to miss others (note how the big web2 players get squeamish around adult content). Those new niches will leave room for upstart and specialty players to find their space._

Which is why we were pleasantly surprised to see that [a smaller, focused metaverse property has arrived](https://www.theblock.co/post/177343/paris-hilton-backed-web3-company-plans-virtual-real-estate-game-for-adults):

> _\[...\] Everyrealm’s new free-to-play game – called Hometopia – will allow players to build virtual homes and communities “alongside friends,” according to the announcement. Players will also be allowed to own that which they create in-game, Everyrealm also said._
> 
> _Everyrealm CEO Janine Yorio calls Hometopia “a gamified combination of Pinterest, Houzz and Wayfair” which is “poised to capture those looking for more adult versions of Roblox interior design games they grew to love as children.”_

Who knew that "grown-ups who wanted to be around other grown-ups, to do ordinary domestic things" would be a metaverse niche?  (Granted, [when Kashmir Hill visited Horizon Worlds](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/gamification-via-p2e-defining-place-and-when-everywhere-means-invisible#depends-what-you-mean-by-place), she noted that she kept running into kids.  So there's that.)

Going back to [our point that being in a metaverse is about digital escapism](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/digital-escapism-case-law-pioneers-and-cant-be-evil-nft-licenses#metaverse-properties-as-digital-escapism), what does it mean when people would want to escape to a simulated housing community? 

It probably means that the real world is full of steep interest rate hikes and [computer-driven rent increases](https://www.propublica.org/article/yieldstar-rent-increase-realpage-rent).  So yes, the digital version sounds just lovely.
