title: "Things Go Wrong™: Mango <strike>hack</strike> trading strategy edition"
---
DeFi platform Mango experienced a hack last week when someone [pulled a twist on a pump-and-dump scam](https://decrypt.co/111833/sam-bankman-fried-on-the-mango-markets-hack-make-up-your-own-damn-mind):

_On Tuesday, an attacker stole $100 million worth of funds from the Mango Markets Solana DeFi trading platform. The attacker used a flaw in Mango Market's design to show they had more collateral than they actually did, drove up the price of the MNGO token, and was then able to talk out a $100 million loan based on the data provided by the platform's oracle._

The story could have ended there with a yawn.  DeFi hacks are ten a penny these days, right?  But the hacker's loot included governance tokens in Mango's DAO.  And in a weird form of shareholder activism, they … [tried to grant themselves amnesty](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/everything-we-know-about-mango-markets-hack-a-20250):

> _The hacker communicated their proposal on the Mango Markets decentralized governance platform and proceeded \[to\] use votes tied to the stolen assets to support the proposition. \[...\]_
> 
> _In a nutshell: A hacker who stole cryptocurrency says they should walk away with the majority of the loot and put that plan up for a vote to the people from whom they stole, using votes tied to the stolen cryptocurrency to vote yes._

That was weird enough, but then things got weirder.  The Mango DAO held a new vote – one that didn't rely on the stolen tokens – and decided to let the hacker keep around $47 million as a <strike>ransom</strike> bug bounty.  An article on [crypto.news](http://crypto.news) says this would be "[the largest bug bounty ever issued in crypto history](https://crypto.news/mango-dao-votes-to-allow-the-hacker-keep-47-million-as-bug-bounty/) to expose vulnerable loopholes on DeFi protocols."  

(Hopefully paying this impromptu bounty doesn't cause legal troubles for Mango.  Just [ask the folks at Uber how that can turn out](https://www.axios.com/2022/10/07/uber-joe-sullivan-conviction-cisos).)

And for the story's final dose of cognitive whiplash, someone claiming to have been behind the event has since explained that this whole thing was not really a "hack," [just a "highly profitable trading strategy."](https://twitter.com/avi_eisen/status/1581326197241180160)

Right.

This has been interesting, but let's hope that Things Go Wrong™ now goes away for a while ...
