title: Handling big fish in a DAO pond

[A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-are-daos-and-why-you-should-care) is a way for groups to pool funds and coordinate actions.  (They've also hit some legal snags, which we described in newsletter [#6](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/this-is-not-legal-advice-but-its-still-worth-a-read#this-is-not-legal-guidance-but-you-probably-want-to-read-it-anyway) and [#23](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/the-other-side-of-web3-loyalty-programs-and-making-web3-disappear#we-only-talk-about-daos-when-theres-trouble), but that's another story.)  DAO members hold special _governance tokens_ which allow them to vote on group issues.

DAOs face a vulnerability in that a "whale" – an individual who holds a disproportionate amount of governance tokens – can sway votes in their favor.  Web3 startup [Otterspace aims to even that playing field](https://www.theblock.co/post/176481/nft-startup-otterspace-raises-3-7-million-to-definancialize-web3-exclusive) by issuing "NFTs that are earned rather than bought to reward certain behavior and recognize participation."  In particular:

> _\[Cofounder Ben\] Dobbrick believes that Otterspace's NFTs badges offer \[...\]  a gateway into governance that isn't dependent on one's holdings. This not only gives influencing power to those that otherwise could not afford it but also engages new DAO members who may only hold a small number of tokens. Importantly these cannot be bought or sold thanks to the specific interface — EIP-4973 — these tokens are built on._

People earning NFTs through specific activities?  That sounds a lot like a web3-based loyalty program. And companies designing such programs will be interested in these NFTs that can't be sold on a secondary market. (See "[Whose Status Is It, Anyway](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/the-other-side-of-web3-loyalty-programs-and-making-web3-disappear#whose-status-is-it-anyway)" for our take.)

Otterspace's approach sounds like one way to address the whale issue in DAOs. Which leads us to:
