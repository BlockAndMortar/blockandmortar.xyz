title: "Well worth a listen: the Improbable founders on “The Scoop”"
---
If you have 45 minutes to spare, we highly recommend [episode 96 of The Scoop podcast](https://www.theblock.co/post/173774/creators-of-bayc-metaverse-think-most-metaverse-land-is-overvalued).  

Don't let the title fool you. The interview with Improbable founders Herman Narula and Rob Whitehead covers a lot more than just the pricing of land in metaverse properties.  They explore what makes a metaverse attractive to participants, where advertising (does not) fit, and why A Certain Company might be taking a big chance on its VR headsets.  The key to it all?  "Authentic engagement."

Overall, we found it to be a deep and thoughtful look at digital escapism through the eyes of experienced practitioners.  If you've enjoyed our metaverse musings, you'll get a lot out of the interview with Narula and Whitehead.
