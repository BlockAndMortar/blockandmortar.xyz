title: Blockchain for the energy sector

There's a lot of excitement in the "upper layers" of the web3 cake. Concerts and [moon landings](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/workplace-moon-landing-nft-tvs-and-no-refunds-maybe#this-sure-beats-your-typical-water-cooler-chat) are running in metaverse properties. DeFi is abuzz with scams, big profits, and bigger losses. NFTs are gaining traction for event tickets and [loyalty programs](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/of-loyalty-and-leadership-titles#a-web3-coffee-odyssey). It's too easy to forget that plain old blockchain, the underlying technology that makes so much of this possible, has other uses.

In the same way that code automates business rules and AI models automate decisions, the core thesis of blockchain is to automate trust. People can put their faith in smart contracts to perform actions and the network to verify activity, instead of having to trust a centralized intermediary (such as a payments processor or stock exchange). In turn, this allows marketplaces to crop up pretty much anywhere.

All of this came to mind as we [read up on some blockchain activity in the energy sector](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/11/02/1062403/accelerating-the-energy-transition-with-web3-technologies/):

> *There are a wide range of opportunities for applications of Web3 and blockchain technology to support the urgent energy transition. For example, Shell and a number of other global firms have launched Avelia, a book-and-claim solution to help scale the supply of sustainable aviation fuel. Technology companies such as Toucan, Moss.Earth, and JustCarbon are tokenizing carbon credits, offering clients a simpler way to offset carbon emissions. Peer-to-peer energy trading is becoming a reality thanks to ventures such as Powerledger, Grid+, and LO3 Energy.*

This space involves a growing number of providers and consumers, many of whom would want to verify records of activity. Building on blockchains makes a lot of sense for energy companies.
