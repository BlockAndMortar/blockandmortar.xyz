title: Be yourself, wherever you go

Self-expression is a key element of metaverse properties. You can personalize your character, or _avatar,_ to just about any shape. You can then deck it out with clothes or accessories as you see fit. And given the work people put into creating these avatars, and the attachment they develop to them, it's understandable that they'd want those representations to carry between different metaverse implementations. It's no fun if you have to rebuild and then maintain your avatar for each metaverse you visit.

All of this is where [Ready Player Me fits into the puzzle](https://lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/ready-player-me-la-start-up-qui-veut-recreer-votre-visage-pour-le-metavers-1783537). They're not creating their own metaverse implementation. Instead, Ready Player Me generates a photorealistic avatar that can move with you from metaverse to metaverse.

Taking a wider view, this is about so much more than just avatars. Ready Player Me is taking a stab at addressing inter-metaverse interoperability, a topic that will only become more important as more virtual worlds appear on the scene. And their fundraising – a $56 million Series B – hints that there is a serious business interest in addressing this problem. There will no doubt be other metaverse interoperability gaps, and we expect new companies to spring up to resolve them.
