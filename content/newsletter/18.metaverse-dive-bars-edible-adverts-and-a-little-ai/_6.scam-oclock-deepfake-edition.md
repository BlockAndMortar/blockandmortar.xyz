title: "Scam O'Clock™: Deepfake edition"
---
Four weeks. Our last Scam O'Clock™ segment was a whopping [four weeks ago](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/new-laws-for-digital-goods-and-keeping-track-of-web3-assets#scam-oclock-even-the-pros-get-hit). And now it's back.

And as you may recall, the trend in web3 scamming has been to impersonate people and organizations that potential victims would trust. This is hardly a new technique, and it's not unique to web3. Remember a few months back, when [a cofounder of media startup Ozy (allegedly!) impersonated a YouTube exec on a phone call with Goldman Sachs](https://www.insider.com/ozy-cofounder-impersonated-youtube-exec-investor-call-goldman-sachs-report-2021-9)? The idea was to make Ozy look more legitimate in Goldman's eyes, in support of a financing deal.

Well, if history repeats, crime evolves. Taking a step beyond hacking Discord servers and Instagram accounts to steal NFTs, [crypto hackers have recently been using a deepfake – an AI-generated doppelganger – of a Binance executive on video calls](https://news.bitcoin.com/hackers-used-deepfake-of-binance-cco-to-perform-exchange-listing-scams/) with crypto projects:

> _The \[deepfake\] was able to fool these projects into believing that they were being considered for listing on Binance and that \[Chief Communications Officer Patrick\] Hillmann was part of this operation._
> 
> _The listing scheme was discovered when these members contacted Hillmann to thank him for his help in the alleged listing opportunities. However, he had no knowledge of these meetings because he is not part of the listing process at Binance._

Look, we could roll our eyes and wonder why these scammers don't get real jobs. We could even ask why they didn't deepfake a Binance executive who was involved in the listing process. But, at least for now, we'll just smile that AI and web3 are playing so nicely together.
