title: "web3 spotlight: Entertainmint"

We recently caught up with our friends at [Entertainmint](https://www.entertainmint.com/). They're not just _applying_ web3 technology to the world of indie streaming content; they've completely _reimagined_ the space, bottom-up, through a web3 lens.

(Full disclosure: when we say "our friends," that's not some euphemism for "a client" or "people paying us to mention their name." They're actually our friends and we think that you'll dig what they're up to.)

Specifically, Entertainmint provides tools for creators to raise funds and build community around their work. And they've just completed their first "show mint" to help Grace Ng turn her Crash Punks NFTs into an animated series. As noted in their recent announcement:

> _We were able to raise 25k for Grace via a multi-tiered mint in five tiers. We helped fans not just buy tickets and see the show--we helped them be IN the show with their Crash Punk, produce the show via an associate producer pass and we even have a Sound Sponsor! We sold 79 NFTs over 2 chains--Opensea/ETH and BTC/Stacks, and they ranged from $100 (general admission) to $10,000 (associate producer.)_
