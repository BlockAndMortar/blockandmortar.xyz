title: When a screen is more than just a screen
---
Longtime readers will notice that we talk a lot about [NFTs with Benefits](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/nfts-with-benefits-the-changing-sands-of-time-and-investing-in-a-country#nfts-with-benefits), where an entry etched into a blockchain serves as an access pass, loyalty card, or anything else that can only be held by one person at a time.  We've also covered [putting NFTs to work](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/two-loans-working-punks-and-canadian-clarity#putting-those-punks-to-work), using a collection's IP rights for commercial advantage.  With all of that business activity, we forget that NFTs also exist as … _art_.  Y'know, things you can appreciate purely for their visual appeal.

What better place to show off your NFT collection than your TV?  That big screen is already the centerpiece of your living room.  It can serve as a dynamic picture frame when you're not watching a movie on [one of your twelve Netflixes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBG9qrEhLVA).  You and your guests can marvel at that piece of digital, generative art the same way you could take in a framed painting. 

Device manufacturer [LG says that your TV should be more than a passive display](https://www.theblock.co/post/167757/tv-maker-lg-electronics-launches-nft-platform-with-hedera), though.   It can do double duty as a portal to an NFT marketplace:

> _LG Art Lab is available in the US on televisions running webOS 5.0 \[or\] later, per the announcement. It includes a feature that offers profiles of artists and previews their upcoming work, as well as a countdown to upcoming NFT “drops.” The platform’s marketplace provides a venue for trading pieces._

This makes sense to us. Modern TVs are effectively computers with outsized monitors.  Why should you have to manage your collection on your computer, then push those images to your TV?

In the same way that a "phone" does so much more than phone calls (truth be told: some of these newsletters are tapped out on a small screen) it's interesting to witness the role of "TV" expand to new areas.  Doubly so when you consider that TV competes with other screens for our attention.  If we're going to watch videos on our computers, phones, and tablets, it's only fair that our TVs should become tools for interacting with online services.
