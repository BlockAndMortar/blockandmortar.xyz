title: This sure beats your typical water-cooler chat

A couple of weeks ago, [we explored the different roles that metaverse properties will fulfill](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/metaverse-dive-bars-edible-adverts-and-a-little-ai#so-which-one-will-be-known-as-the-dive-bar):

> _The world is still sorting out what counts as a "metaverse" and what it's good for, but metaverse properties are each starting to find their role and vibe.  \[...\]_
> 
> _Consider the big names in the metaverse properties. Roblox and Fortnite? People go here for events, like games or concerts. Horizon Worlds? This is where you pretend to pay attention to work meetings. The Sandbox? It's feeling pretty retail-focused thus far._

So, yes, we can look forward to more Corporate Workplace Metaverses. But they needn't be dull, digital replicas of your conference rooms.  This is an opportunity for companies to explore the new capabilities a metaverse property offers.  

Financial firm Daiwa Securities has done just that in building a [moon-landing simulator](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-07/a-120-year-old-broker-creates-moon-landing-metaverse-for-staff):

> _In Daiwa’s metaverse, its more than 15,000 staff worldwide can manipulate avatars on the virtual moon. They can chat with colleagues at a bar over a digital beer, listen to Chief Executive Officer Seiji Nakata make a speech in a theater, and tour a replica of the firm’s old headquarters._

Daiwa Securities _gets it._  Instead of saying "I dunno … do 3-D meetings?" they said "hey we can use this as a cool workplace bonding activity."  This is in line with our point that [a metaverse is a place for digital escapism and shared experiences](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/digital-escapism-case-law-pioneers-and-cant-be-evil-nft-licenses#metaverse-properties-as-digital-escapism).  

Something to keep in mind as you stake out your company's metaverse property.  Why limit yourself to simple, VR equivalents of your existing office?
