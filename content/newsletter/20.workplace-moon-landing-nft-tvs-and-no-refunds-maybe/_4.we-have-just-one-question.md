title: We have just one question

Ticketmaster, the ubiquitous live-events middleman, [has entered the NFT space](https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Daily/Issues/2022/08/31/Marketing-and-Sponsorship/Ticketmaster-Flow-blockchain-NFT.aspx):

> _Event organizers that sell live events tickets on Ticketmaster can now issue NFTs before, during and after live events through a new offering in conjunction with Dapper Labs' Flow blockchain. The goal is to unlock unique integrations throughout the fan journey._

This is hardly a surprise. Companies are using NFTs as tickets, and Ticketmaster is in the tickets business.  They've clearly [thought through the memorabilia aspect of show tickets](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/31/ticketmaster-partners-with-blockchain-firm-dapper-labs-to-issue-nfts-for-live-events/), as well: 

> _\[ …\] Ticketmaster has integrated a wallet feature and digital marketplace into its website, facilitating collectors' efforts to share, trade and view the NFTs they earn._

Our only remaining question, then: will they issue separate tokens named "handling charge" and "convenience fee?" Or will those show up as attributes of the NFTs?
