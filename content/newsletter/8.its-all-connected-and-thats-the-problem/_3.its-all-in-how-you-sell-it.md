title: It's all in how you sell it

Trouble was brewing in the cryptocurrency space even before Celsius and 3AC blew up. General issues in the sector, complicated by fears of a wider economic downturn, have led some crypto companies to [lay off a portion of their staff](https://www.theblock.co/post/152059/crypto-firms-have-laid-off-more-than-1500-people-in-the-last-two-months-as-downturn-fears-persist).  

Some of the affected employees may find their next job in the regulatory space.  [FINRA CEO Robert Cook opened that door](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/wall-st-watchdog-finra-bulk-up-crypto-capabilities-ceo-says-2022-06-14/) when he discussed the group's plans to become more deeply involved in crypto affairs: "We're going to need to be engaged and prepared to have the resources to do that, so anybody who is getting laid off from a crypto platform and wants to work for FINRA, give me a call."

This strikes us as a smart move. FINRA would do well to have experienced, crypto-knowledgeable people on its team.  (Though, given recent events, will there be any crypto left to regulate?)   

Maybe Cook can sweeten the deal for the recently downsized recruits by offering them fancy titles.  As a gift to the fine folks at FINRA, we offer "Karma Specialist," "VP of Revenge," and "Chief Payback Officer."
