title: "Can we say that he's “in the $DOGE house?”"

Elon Musk was apparently late to join a meeting with Twitter staff this week.  Perhaps he was busy dealing with [a lawsuit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/06/16/elon-musk-suddenly-hit-with-huge-258-billion-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-lawsuit-amid-a-devastating-bitcoin-and-ethereum-price-crash/)?  Along with his companies Tesla and SpaceX, he's accused of engaging in a cryptocurrency pyramid scheme.

This is when we could get into the description of the charges (racketeering).  Or the amount in damages (total $258 billion).  Or that it involves cryptocurrency (DogeCoin). Or even that Musk is very clear on his stance (["I will keep supporting Dogecoin"](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1538406040374595585)).

We could do that.  But we won't.  

We actually don't have anything to add to this story.  We just wanted an excuse to use the joke you see in our headline.  

Carry on.  Nothing to see here.
