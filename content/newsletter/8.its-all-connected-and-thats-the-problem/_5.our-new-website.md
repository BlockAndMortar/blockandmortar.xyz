We'd like to extend a special thanks to our subscribers.  Not only did you sign up to read our weekly musings on web3, but you did so in spite of our old, barebones website.  Consider yourselves our early fans.  From our indie-rock days.  When we were still recording songs in our basement.

We have now entered The Big Time™.  Please check out our new, fancy website… which also lists our new, fancy services:

This is just the beginning.  Over time, we plan to roll out even more content.  Tutorials.  Workshops.  Consulting.  Who  knows? Maybe there'll be some stray NFTs. Stay tuned!
