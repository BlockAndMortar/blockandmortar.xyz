Netflix's hit animated series _Love, Death + Robots_ has returned for its third season.  So, apparently, Netflix doesn't kill _every_ original show that people like.  Just … most of them?  

Perhaps this show gets to stick around because [LD+R now involves an NFT scavenger hunt](https://decrypt.co/101346/netflix-launches-third-volume-of-love-death-robots-with-nft-scavenger-hunt).  Viewers mint NFTs related to the show by scanning QR codes found on billboards, in social media posts, and even in the show's episodes.  

[Larva Labs](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/amp/linked/137757/how-three-friends-cracked-larva-labss-secret-treasure-hunt-for-a-25000-meebit) and [NFT Worlds](https://nftevening.com/the-nft-worlds-scavenger-hunt-reward-totals-around-a-huge-90k/) are also running blockchain scavenger hunts. This kind of game is a creative way to boost engagement through audience participation.  Players solve clues to sort out a twelve-word passphrase, which unlocks an Ethereum wallet containing NFT prizes.

(Our question: When do we get something on the size and collaborative scale of, say, 2004's [I Love Bees campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Love_Bees)?)

The entertainment industry continues to explore web3 for other engagement opportunities.  _The Gimmicks_, an animated series from Mila Kunis's production company, will [allow NFT holders to vote on the show's plot](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/03/14/this-mila-kunis-backed-tv-show-lets-nft-holders-choose-the-plot/).  And Mad Realities, [recent recipient of $6M in funding](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/143204/entertainment-company-mad-realities-raises-6-million-to-create-decentralized-media) (including some cash from Paris Hilton), plans to operate as a DAO such that members can co-develop shows.
