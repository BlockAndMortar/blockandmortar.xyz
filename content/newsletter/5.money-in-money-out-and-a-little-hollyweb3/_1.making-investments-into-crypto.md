title: Making investments into crypto
---
Technology is hot, investor money is pouring in from all sides, and companies are offering food delivery by bike messenger.  No, we haven't returned to 1999. All of this interest is pointed squarely at web3 projects.  One article, citing data from CB insights, pointed to an [eightfold increase in blockchain-related VC investment from 2020 to 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/crypto-start-ups-raised-huge-venture-funding-rounds-in-january.html).

To understand this turn of events, it helps to consider two key points about investing:

1.  **Money flowing into a space reflects investor confidence.**  An investment is a means by which you express a belief ("I think this company is going places!") with your money ("I am willing to put my cold, hard cash into this company").  It's a magic money machine: you put money in now, because you expect even more money to come back later. 
    
2.  **Venture capital is similar to emerging-markets investing.** VCs know that only some of their portfolio companies will pan out.  But that's OK. So long as they occasionally land the next Google or Facebook, the asymmetric returns from _those_ investments will wipe out the losses from every startup that craters.

For Point 1, consider the recent announcements: [Kongregate and Immutable have paired up to run a $40 million fund](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/148827/web-game-developer-kongregate-and-immutable-launch-40-million-fund-for-blockchain-games). [Volt Capital has raised a $50 million fund](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/25/soona-amhazs-volt-debuts-50m-crypto-fund-backed-by-marc-andreessen-chris-dixon/). Andreesen Horowitz [(a16z) has launched a **_$4.5 billion_** crypto fund](https://a16zcrypto.com/crypto-fund-four/).  All of this money reflects the growing confidence in web3's business potential.  And there are probably several more such announcements that we've missed.  

Point 2 gets an extra jolt because of simple economics.   Crypto has come down a few pegs over the last months – including a big hit from the recent TerraUSD/Luna crash – so it's running at a discount.  These lower prices, driven by others' reduced confidence in crypto, leave room for the more bullish investors to step in.  They get to spread their same investment pool over a larger number of (now, cheaper) portfolio companies.  Because they can buy more  startup lottery tickets, they improve their chances of landing on a big winner. 

Before you rush to throw money at every crypto-themed startup, though, you'll want a deeper understanding of the technologies so you can spot what's real.  Alan Howard, [co-founder of hedge fund Brevan Howard, says it best](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/146212/alan-howard-crypto-interview):

> _You have to be in, and have exposure to, the crypto world to understand what is going on there, to identify the challenges and opportunities you’ll face and to know what infrastructure you will have to build to meet those challenges and opportunities head on._

(BH Digital, a Brevan Howard vehicle focused on crypto, aims to deploy more than $1 billion into the space.)

Wise words for investing in any emerging-technology arena.  And if we _are_ reliving the Dot-Com heyday, let's try to avoid recreating the Enron and Worldcom scandals, shall we?
