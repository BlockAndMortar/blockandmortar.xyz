It didn't take long for the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT characters to wander into the entertainment business.  Universal Music Group has laid out plans to [launch a BAYC band](https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/medias/universal-music-lance-un-groupe-dans-le-metavers-1365043), and [Coinbase is making BAYC movies](https://www.fastcompany.com/90740618/why-coinbase-is-making-a-crowdsourced-film-trilogy-with-bored-ape-yacht-club).  Most recently, actor and producer Seth "[Scott Evil](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145660/)" Green has been writing a series called _White Horse Tavern_ built around his Bored Ape NFT.

Last week Green [lost some NFTs to a phishing scam](https://twitter.com/sethgreen/status/1526588358859759617), [including the aforementioned TV-bound BAYC character](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahemerson/seth-green-bored-ape-stolen-tv-show).  This raised the question of whether he would still be able to use the Bored Ape in the show.  On the one hand, the commercial usage rights in theory belong to whomever owns the wallet holding the NFT.  That person could possibly sue Seth Green for continuing with _White Horse Tavern_.  On the other hand, Green didn't exactly plan to let the NFT out of his possession. So … 

To use highly technical legal terminology, _it's complicated._  Few crypto cases have been tried in the courts so there's little legal precedent to go on.  As we often say at Brick & Mortar HQ: _you never want to be a case law pioneer_.  But that is where this kind of situation leads.

Still, NFT thefts are so common these days, especially among BAYC holders.  Which might be why [securities-lawyer-turned-Bloomberg-columnist Matt Levine took a jab](https://twitter.com/matt_levine/status/1529185869898424321) at the story:

> _imagine making a whole television show about bored apes that was not about bored apes getting stolen_

As of this writing, [Green has been reunited with his BAYC NFT](https://twitter.com/SethGreen/status/1531267330725974016) so he's clear to continue with the show.  

Now if you'll excuse us, we need to get back to work.  We're writing a series on the shenanigans of publishing a web3 newsletter.  (Anybody wanna join our DAO? You'll get to vote on the plot…)
