They only have the life and personality that they are given.  They only "exist" when and where the company wants them to.  They can't get into trouble.  \[...\]  These BAYC band members are the perfect, low-risk celebrities – wrapped up tight like a movie script._

If you're suddenly feeling nervous about your company's celebrity partnerships, maybe a band made of highly-scripted NFT apes is looking like a safer alternative.
