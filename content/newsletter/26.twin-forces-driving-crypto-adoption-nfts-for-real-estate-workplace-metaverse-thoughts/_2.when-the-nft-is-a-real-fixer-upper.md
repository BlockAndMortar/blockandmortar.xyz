title: When the NFT is a real fixer-upper
---
One of your Block & Mortar editors has observed something about emerging technology: the highly-technical stuff gets all the attention up-front … but the non-technical matters – law, insurance, policy – dominate in the long run.  

The reason is pretty simple: it's hard to just throw the small-but-growing New And Shiny into the vast Old And Long-Standing.  (Consider the insurance companies sorting out what it means to write coverage for an autonomous vehicle…)  It takes a little extra ingenuity to wrap the New inside the framework of the Old, so they can coexist.  

Crypto is no exception.  Consider this case of real estate company Roofstock [selling a house as an NFT](https://www.theblock.co/post/177926/south-carolina-house-sold-as-nft-for-175000).  That's the eye-catching headline, sure.  But the details are more interesting: 

> _Each rental property sold on its platform via NFT is owned by an individual single-purpose Limited Liability Company (LLC) registered in Wyoming and the NFT sold is associated with the sole ownership of the LLC, the company told The Block._
> 
> _\[...\]_
> 
> _“The sale of the NFT results in a change in the ownership of the LLC, and thus the underlying property,” a company spokesperson said._

This is a useful blend of new-world web3 tech and existing real estate law concepts.  We can't wait to see future refinements of this process, as well as applications beyond real estate.
