title: "Well worth a listen: the Bloomberg Crypto podcast"
---
Do you like learning on the go? Bloomberg Crypto will keep you up-to-date on web3, in plain language, in just fifteen minutes a day.  

We first mentioned this podcast in [newsletter #9](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/nfts-sight-sound-and-smells#well-worth-a-listen), shortly after its launch, and the show has just passed its hundred-episode milestone.  

If you go back a couple of days to [episode 99 – "You’ll Still Hate Your Manager in The Metaverse,"](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2022-10-20/you-ll-still-hate-your-manager-in-the-metaverse-podcast) host [stacy-marie ishmael](https://twitter.com/s_m_i) (yes, she lowercases her name) and guest Matthew Boyle explore the idea of corporate metaverse properties and employee participation therein.  If your company is thinking of setting up a metaverse, or you're already running one, take a listen.  You'll thank us later.
