title: Preparing the job market well in advance
---
The tech job market is a high-demand, low-supply space.  Even with the popularity of "boot camp" training programs, companies can't seem to find enough software developers and data scientists.  Amazon Technical Academy, for example, went as far as to [open its doors to people outside of the company](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-expanding-upskill-training-software-developer-roles-workers-outside-company/) last year.

Creating a training program to backfill empty roles can help, but it's a reactive approach. Facebook – ahem, Meta – is getting ahead of the game.  [Working with tech school Simplon, the company plans to offer training for web3 technologies in France](https://lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/meta-lance-une-academie-du-metavers-1412677).  The program is open to the public, regardless of academic background.  (Admission will be based on interviews and code challenges.) 

To be clear, this is not a hiring pipeline into Meta.  While some graduates will no doubt join Formerly-Known-As Facebook, they may also find themselves filling metaverse job openings elsewhere.  Some could even use these new skills to build their own companies.   Whatever the case, it looks like Meta is playing the long game in the hopes of growing the wider metaverse ecosystem.
