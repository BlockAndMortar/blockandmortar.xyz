title: But will it also make phone calls?
---
New York City was the home of the [NTF.](http://NTF.NYC)[NYC](https://www.nft.nyc) and ApeFest 2022 conferences this past week.  There was plenty of news to go around – including the release of an [NFT-themed music video by Snoop Dogg and Eminem](https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/24/23181936/bayc-eminem-snoop-dogg-yuga-labs-nft) – but one item stood out: [the team behind the Solana blockchain unveiled the Saga, a new phone](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/solana-saga-is-a-fancy-android-phone-for-crypto-traders/). 

> _The Saga is a central part of Solana's attempt to make cryptocurrency apps more mobile friendly. Many crypto, decentralized finance and NFT applications are more limited on mobile than on desktop, or have cumbersome user interfaces. Anatoly Yakovenko, CEO of Solana, joked at the event that he still sees people pull out laptops on dates in order to mint new NFTs. "Web3 still feels like we're in the year 2007," Solana mobile head engineer Steven Laver said at the event._

On the one hand, a crypto-themed handheld device was inevitable. (By "device," we don't just mean hardware wallets.  Those have been around for a while now.  And we highly encourage you to get one for your pricier investments.)  So we applaud Solana for being the first big name to this party.  As [Yakovenko pointed out](https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/23/23180421/osom-solana-saga-android-crypto-phone-announced-sms), "We didn’t see a single crypto announcement at Apple’s developer conference, 13 years after Bitcoin went live. I think it’s going to be up to us."

On the other hand, Solana is exploring new territory not just for itself but for the wider industry.  That leaves a lot of open questions.  How many people will ditch their phone for a Saga?  Will there be higher switching costs for iOS users, since Saga is based on Android?  How many people will use a Saga as their primary phone, as opposed making it their separate, crypto-only device?  And let's not get into the ongoing maintenance, such as deploying OS patches.  Or growing and maintaining the app ecosystem.

(We're not as worried about the primary hurdle, that of actually building a device. Solana has partnered with handset maker Osom and the Saga is a rebranding of their existing OV1 model.)

The real question, then, is not about whether this particular device will succeed.  It's about what _other_ companies will enter the market for dedicated crypto handhelds. And what a wider ecosystem of those devices will mean for adoption of cryptocurrency and unlocking new capabilities.  Not to mention, whether this will lead to more "crypto-enabled phones" or "crypto-specific devices that are separate from phones."  Time will tell.
