Paris will host the 2024 Olympic Games.  The event is still ("only?") two years away and the city is already deep into planning.

Olympics envoy Michel Cadot submitted a report to the French government outlining recommendations for, among other things, security.  And one item on the docket is the potential to use NFTs for ticketing. ([French](https://journalducoin.com/defi/blockchain-rescousse-jo-paris-2024-web-3/) , [English](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-ticketing-may-catch-on-faster-in-france-after-uefa-championship-debacle))

This would hardly be the first event to use NFTs in this fashion; but when you consider the size and scale of the Olympics, this would be one hell of a road test.  Consider what it would take to deploy and maintain a system for selling, distributing, and validating the NFTs.  And then there's the potential for people to hold those NFTs as memorabilia, or even resell them as collectibles.

(This is when we'd also mention the environmental impact of paperless tickets, but let's first see whether the underlying blockchain is an energy hog...)

If you've been thinking about using NFTs as tickets, VIP passes, or similar, keep an eye on Paris 2024. And maybe check out this story about a [Paris blockchain conference that encountered some ticket scalpers when it used NFT-based tickets](https://www.theblock.co/post/153562/a-paris-crypto-conference-suffers-a-curious-case-of-nft-ticket-scalping-gone-wrong).  There are still some rough patches to iron out in this kind of system.
