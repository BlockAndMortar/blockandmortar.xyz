title: Well worth a listen

If you work in the tech space, you never stop learning.  The field changes so much, and so quickly, that you need a steady stream of articles and books to keep track of new developments.

If audio is more your style, we've recently come across two podcasts to boost your web3 knowledge.

The first is [Bloomberg Crypto](https://www.bloomberg.com/podcasts/series/bloomberg-crypto).  These short, focused, daily episodes get to the bottom of current topics in the crypto/DeFi space.  The show is hosted by [Stacy-Marie Ishmael](https://twitter.com/s_m_i), managing editor of Bloomberg's cryptocurrencies unit.  (You may also recognize her name as the co-founder of the Financial Times Alphaville.)  Each episode runs about ten or fifteen minutes.  That should fit into even the busiest of schedules.

The second is last week's episode of La Story, from French business newspaper _Les Echos_. "[Pourquoi les entreprises craquent pour le métavers](https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/pourquoi-les-entreprises-craquent-pour-le-metavers-1415704)" explores key metaverse concepts, what kinds of businesses are getting involved, and even some use cases.  If you understand French and have a half-hour of free time, it's well worth a listen.
