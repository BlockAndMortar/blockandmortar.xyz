title: But we thought crypto was all “no take-backs?”
---
In August 2020, just a few months into the Covid-19 pandemic, Citibank had intended to pay interest on some loans [but instead repaid them in full.  To the tune of about $900 million](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-citigroup-revlon-lawsuit-idUSKBN2AG1TJ). 

The whole point of a loan is for lenders to collect a steady stream of interest over the years, so this should have been a quick _"oh ha ha, yeh here's that money back, please keep those interest payments coming."_  But in this case – perhaps due to the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic? – the lenders chose to keep the money. And, no surprise, the bank filed lawsuits in an attempt to get the money back.

We're seeing a similar story play out in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space right now.  [Cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/31/23330458/crypto-dot-com-typo-mistake-refund-audit) [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) [typo'd a wallet address and mistakenly sent someone about $7 million](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/31/23330458/crypto-dot-com-typo-mistake-refund-audit).  What can they do about it?

*   **On a technical level,** [**Crypto.com**](http://Crypto.com) **can't claw the money back.**  Cryptocurrency transactions only support the "push" of a deposit, not the "pull" of a withdrawal.  So the company can't reach into that other wallet and take back the $7 million.
    
*   **On a legal level,** [**Crypto.com**](http://Crypto.com) **… maybe has a chance?  Perhaps?**  They've filed a lawsuit and the courts have frozen the recipient's bank accounts.  

Still, it's complicated.  As we've said before, no one wants to be a case law pioneer.  And since the court system is sorely lacking in Crypto Transaction Typo cases (as opposed to the more common Crypto Phishing Theft cases) that is precisely where the opposing parties find themselves right now. 

[Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) could have quietly swallowed the loss, and treated it as a (very expensive) lesson in developing more robust internal protocols.  This would have cost them the original $7 million, plus some extra money in implementing the aforementioned protocols, but that would have been the end of the story.

Having filed the lawsuit, they've closed the door on the quiet option.  Now the whole world not only knows that the company goofed, but that it took them seven months to notice.  Additionally, a core tenet of crypto is that your transactions are your responsibility.  It's up to you to double- and triple-check both the amount and the destination wallet address before you click "send."  (Ask anyone who has issued an international wire transfer.  It's the same level of anxiety.)  So by filing the lawsuit, they're also making some cultural waves.

A verdict in [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com)'s favor means that they get the money back yet lose street cred with the hardcore DeFi crowd.  It's hard to put a price tag on that reputation risk, but it's possible that the long-term impacts could far exceed the $7 million.

Then again, this could also provide more _mainstream_ support for DeFi by showing that it is not the lawless hellhole it usually is sometimes seems to be.  When clearly erroneous transactions can indeed be reversed – even if it requires a judge to override the technical matters of wallet mechanics – everyday people feel safer because they know that they won't get burned by making an honest mistake.  Think of this as adding referees and padded gloves to a bare-knuckle boxing league.

What if courts rule in favor of the lucky wallet-holder?  This is the worst-case scenario for [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com), really.  The company would lose the $7 million in cash (which, one could argue, they already have already lost), they'd take a reputation hit (likely becoming a pariah in some corners of DeFi), and the move could possibly reduce mainstream interest in cryptocurrencies.
