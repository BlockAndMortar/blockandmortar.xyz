title: Scam o'clock
---
Didn't we cover a scam just last week?  Indeed we did.  But in the world of crypto, it's always scam o'clock. Or maybe Scam Week?  This time around, Sprise co-founder @Montana\_Wong shares details of an exploit that's making the rounds. 

Remember how some groups release free NFTs in order to build a buzz? Since it costs people nothing to get the NFTs, but they may someday be valuable, there is a strong incentive to grab the freebies and then talk them up. 

Scammers have hopped onto this trend, claiming connections to legitimate projects (say, requiring that you already own an NFT from \[insert famous collection here\]). A few clicks later, your special NFTs are gone. 

We recommend reading [@Montana\_Wong's full thread for details](https://twitter.com/Montana_Wong/status/1545081928017031168).  And remember: when it comes to acquiring NFTs – even the free ones – it helps to slow down and be a little skeptical.
