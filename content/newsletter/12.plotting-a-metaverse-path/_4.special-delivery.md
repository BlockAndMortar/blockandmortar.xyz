On the subject of use cases for NFTs, here's one we most certainly did not have on our web3 bingo card: serving legal notice.   

We've now seen cases like this in both the [US](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/are-you-being-served-court-authorizes-service-process-airdrop) and the [UK](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-13/you-ve-been-served-via-nft-court-gives-ok-to-sue-on-blockchain).  Maybe it will catch on elsewhere?  If it does, this could open up a new avenue for process servers.  No disguises, no sneaking around, just … locating the relevant wallet address and air-dropping the papers. But maybe don't hold your breath for a web3 reboot of [_Pineapple Express_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineapple_Express_(film)).

We expect the courts will eventually require more acknowledgement than pure air-dropping.  When that happens, the aforementioned scams will probably take on a whole new dimension.  "No, we didn't steal any of your NFTs.  But you _did_ just confirm your identity, so … here you go.  See you in court."
