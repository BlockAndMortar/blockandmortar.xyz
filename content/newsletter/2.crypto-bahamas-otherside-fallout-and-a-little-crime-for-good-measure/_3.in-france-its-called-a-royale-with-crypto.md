title: In France, it's called a “Royale with Crypto”
---
FTX isn't the only crypto exchange with something to celebrate. French financial regulator l'Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) gave Binance the green light this week. 

The AMF's approval grants Binance the authority to offer new services in France and to directly market within the country. Binance plans to hire 250 people to build out its new Paris office, which will serve as the hopping-off point for its European expansion.
