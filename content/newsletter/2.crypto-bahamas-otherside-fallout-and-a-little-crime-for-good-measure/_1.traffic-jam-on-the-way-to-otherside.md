title: Traffic jam on the way to Otherside
---
Last weekend saw the launch of [Otherside deeds](https://opensea.io/collection/otherdeed), the NFTs used to claim property in the highly-anticipated [Otherside metaverse](https://otherside.xyz/). 

Few details are known about Otherside – the [promo trailer](https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1505014986556551172) didn't exactly drop a lot of hints – but that didn’t stop enthusiasts from shelling out over $300 million in ApeCoin ($APE)  to mint their NFT deeds. This is a victory for parent company Yuga Labs (also home to the Bored Ape Yacht Club), right?  Sort of.  

The rush of buying activity brought the underlying Ethereum blockchain network to its knees, and drove up the gas fees that people pay for each attempted transaction.  Emphasis on "attempted." People had to pay gas fees even if their transaction didn't go through.

In total, all of this activity [burned more than $157M in gas fees](https://decrypt.co/99219/otherside-nft-mint-burned-more-157m-ethereum). And, interestingly enough, the price of the ApeCoin dropped steeply following the event.  That $300 million in ApeCoin is closer to $150 million as of this writing. 

Yuga Labs [issued an apology](https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1520612362986078208) and promised to refund gas fees for those who failed to mint:

> _“We are aware that some users had failed transactions due to the incredible demand being forced through Ethereum’s bottleneck. For those of you affected, we appreciate your willingness to build alongside us – know that we’ve got your back and will be refunding your gas.”_

Regardless, the Otherside metaverse appears to be on track to create something unique and special. We hope to hear more about the game mechanics and other such details in the coming weeks.
