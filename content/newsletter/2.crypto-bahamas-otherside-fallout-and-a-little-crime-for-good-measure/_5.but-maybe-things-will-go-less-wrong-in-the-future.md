title: … but maybe, Things Will Go Less Wrong In The Future?™

Despite the phrase, _"the_ blockchain," there are many blockchains out there.  And every cryptocurrency rides atop a single blockchain.   It's sort of like hotel points, frequent flier miles, or in-store gift cards.  A given token is only valid on its home blockchain.  

A _bridge_ is a crypto equivalent of a currency exchange, in that it (effectively) moves tokens from one underlying blockchain to another.  This is handy for you.  And also tempting for criminals, since so much value moves through bridges.  

Sometimes it helps to patronize a high-profile, name-brand currency exchange to reduce your risk of getting scammed.  After high-profile attacks this year on the decentralized [Wormhole](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22916111/wormhole-hack-github-error-325-million-theft-ethereum-solana) and [Ronin](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/04/05/ronin-attack-shows-cross-chain-crypto-is-a-bridge-too-far/) bridges, established crypto exchanges like [FTX and Coinbase are aiming to provide bridge-like services](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-07/crypto-bridge-heists-swiping-1-billion-spur-race-for-options) to address this concern.  According to a piece by Bloomberg's Olga Kharif:  

> _"It wouldn’t shock me if more users wanted exchanges as bridges given their expertise and bankroll," Sam Bankman-Fried, chief executive officer of FTX, said in an email. "We’re currently bridging some chains together and are thinking about potentially doing more."_

The exchanges improve customer adoption and retention by providing the service, and customers get extra assurance from working with well-known companies.  Seems like a win-win.

Taking a wider view, it's interesting to see centralized services stepping in as a way to reduce consumer risk.  On the one hand, bringing trust to a field increases adoption.  On the other hand, decentralization is a key tenet of crypto.  What will be the ideal – or, at least, "settled-upon" – balance of decentralized versus centralized in web3?
