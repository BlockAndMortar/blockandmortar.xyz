What do Tom Brady, Orlando Bloom, and Anthony Scaramucci have in common? Sure, they have As in their name.  More importantly, they were among the attendees of [Sam Bankman-Fried’s Crypto Bahamas](https://decrypt.co/99088/ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-crypto-bahamas) event.  This four-day business conference was a gathering of celebrities and Wall Street who’s-who to discuss the future of finance and web3.

The Bahamas, which is one of the only countries where companies can obtain a license for both crypto derivatives and the spot market, is [quickly becoming the hub for crypto exchanges](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2022/04/27/crypto-bahamas-kicks-off-as-country-solidifies-plans-to-become-leading-digital-asset-hub-amidst-market-uncertainty/?sh=60c7aa5af007) like Bankman-Fried’s FTX. Maybe it’s the loose business-friendly laws, maybe it’s the paper umbrellas in the drinks… who knows?
