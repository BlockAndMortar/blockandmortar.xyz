title: "Things Are Still Going Wrong™: More Terra/Luna fallout"
---
You may recall from [our previous newsletter](/newsletter/what-the-hell-just-happened) – or, perhaps, from pretty much any other news source over the past couple of weeks – that the cryptocurrency space has had a rough time.  A lot of this was connected to the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin and its sibling token Luna.  The Luna freefall is over for now, but there's still plenty of cleanup to do.

Terraform Labs CEO [Do Kwon has floated some ideas](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/147976/do-kwon-amends-terra-2-0-proposal-during-the-vote-on-it) on how to get everything back on track. But he's also a little busy, as [Korean financial authorities have asked him to drop by for a chat](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/20/terra-creator-do-kwon-faces-prosecutions-in-south-korea/).  Which may be tougher for him to manage, now that [the Terraform Labs legal team has left](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/147390/terraform-labs-legal-team-resigns-after-ust-collapse).

(We're not sure of the exact circumstances of their departure, but your Block & Mortar editors know that it's rarely a good sign when your attorneys say "peace out."  We also know that [broadcasting to social media](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1527748229470646272) may not be the best way to find a new legal team, but that's another story.)

The TerraUSD/Luna crash was a reminder that investing in cryptocurrencies involves a  risk/reward tradeoff.  That is built, in part, on the lack of government involvement in the space: you can make a lot of money, very quickly, but there's no SEC or FDIC equivalent to soften the blow if you lose it all.   Galaxy Capital CEO (and, shall we say, [decorated](https://twitter.com/novogratz/status/1478535972560195585) Luna investor) [Mike Novogratz echoed a common refrain](https://twitter.com/novogratz/status/1526970321890312192%20(which%20points%20to%20https://s27.q4cdn.com/973063916/files/doc_news/2022/A-Letter-From-our-CEO-Mike-Novogratz_5.18.2022.pdf) from the wider financial space when he pointed out:

> _\[I\]t’s important that less experienced market participants only risk what they are comfortable losing. I’ve often said people should allocate 1%-5% of their assets to the space._

You can't win if you don't play, sure.  You also can't lose.
