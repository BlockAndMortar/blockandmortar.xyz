The headline going around is that DJ duo The Chainsmokers will [use NFTs to share royalties from their latest album](https://nftevening.com/the-chainsmokers-share-album-royalties-with-their-fans-through-nfts/) "So Far So Good" with fans.  (If you squint just right, this is not too far from [Bowie Bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bowie-bond.asp).  Though it's probably lighter on the regulatory side of things.)  As NFTs are variable-priced assets that can be bought and sold, we expect there will be some interesting correlations between price movements and band-related news such as tour dates.

The 5,000 NFT holders will split 1% of the revenue from _streaming_, though.  And artists routinely point out that streaming revenue is very small.  So we don't think the revenue share is the big story here.

Frankly, what we find more interesting is how The Chainsmokers are using those 5,000 NFTs to _build a community_.  NFT holders get perks such as tickets to live shows and access to a private Discord channel hosted by the band.

Business owners, take note.  This is another example of organizations using NFTs for tickets, group membership, and VIP passes.  Those old paper ticket stubs serve as [souvenirs and bragging rights](https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/proofs-of-attendance-are-web3s-new-status-symbol), so it's no surprise that we're now seeing the digital equivalent.
