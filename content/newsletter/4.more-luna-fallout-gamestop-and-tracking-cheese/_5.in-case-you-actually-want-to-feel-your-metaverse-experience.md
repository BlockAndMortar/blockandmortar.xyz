title: In case you actually want to feel your metaverse experience
---
While the world is still sorting out a firm definition of "metaverse," one common thread involves building on concepts from the video gaming world.  Game controllers have long offered haptic feedback, which provides an extra element of immersion by shaking and buzzing in reaction to in-game events. But the company [Skinetic is taking it to a new level with their haptic vest](https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/on-a-teste-skinetic-la-veste-haptique-qui-permet-de-ressentir-les-jeux-video_AV-202205210011.html).

By emitting vibrations at key points along the body, in sync with what's happening on-screen, Skinetic's vest can simulate the feeling of wind, rain, and even explosions.  Still, there's the question of how much simulated "reality" we'll want to bring with us into metaverse properties. The answer will depend on the experience at hand.
