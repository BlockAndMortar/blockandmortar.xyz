title: Getty dips its toes into the NFT space
---
From [pro basketball](https://nbatopshot.com) to [auction houses](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/14/arts/design/nft-art-market-sothebys.html) to [even The Vatican](https://nftevening.com/the-vatican-is-creating-an-official-nft-gallery/), groups that hold libraries of digital content are offering NFTs.  It's no surprise, then, that stock photo giant [Getty is getting a taste of that NFT action](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-17/getty-images-to-sell-nfts-with-fanatics-owned-candy-digital-in-multiyear-deal) through a partnership with Candy Digital.

It'd be easy to write this off as Old-School Company Tries the New Hotness.  We've certainly seen a lot of that in the ML/AI space, where companies dove in because they felt like they were being "left behind" in the trend.  So we expect to see the same with web3. 

But in Getty's case, the web3 connection makes a lot of sense: they manage a catalog of more than 450 million digital images; their business involves licensing those images; and NFTs are commonly treated as deeds to digital goods.  Getty may as well (carefully) explore what's possible. 

That said, [the company's announcement](http://press.gettyimages.com/getty-images-enters-exclusive-partnership-with-candy-digital-to-introduce-its-first-ever-nfts/) did not go into detail on licensing terms.  Perhaps, after this first round, Getty will manage some portion of their photo licensing through blockchain technologies?  Time will tell.
