title: “It's only valid if it comes from the Blockchaine région of France…”

We're fast approaching a time when companies will shoehorn the term "blockchain" into _anything_ they do_,_ just to lay claim to using the technology. So we admit that we were a little skeptical when we saw this headline about [mixing blockchain and cheese](https://twitter.com/s_m_i/status/1527047209753141252). But barely two paragraphs in, we realized that this was about a [serious supply chain and fraud-prevention matter](https://www.foodandwine.com/news/parmigiano-reggiano-fraud-micro-transponder-rinds-digital-label): 

> _Like many European products, true "Parmesan" cheese has a protected designation of origin, and according to the Parmigiano Reggiano Consortium (the official trade group for the cheese) the amount of fraud is almost as big as product sales: Authentic Parmigiano Reggiano sales are around $2.44 billion while fraudulent cheese is a $2.08 billion market._

When the revenue from fake goods is roughly the same as that of the authentic variety, that's a problem.  The Consortium, in partnership with Kaasmerk Matec and p-Chip, addresses this fraud by pairing transponders embedded in cheese wheels with blockchain-based "digital twins" that represent the physical goods.  

This sounds like a practical application of blockchain technology.  If we can follow blockchain transactions to track provenance of digital artwork, why can't we use it for goods in a supply chain?
