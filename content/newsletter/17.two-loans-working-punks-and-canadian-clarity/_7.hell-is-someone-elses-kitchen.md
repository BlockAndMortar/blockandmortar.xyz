title: "Hell is … someone else's kitchen"

We recently saw an announcement that [Gordon Ramsay is setting up his Hell's Kitchen concept in The Sandbox's metaverse](https://twitter.com/Blockworks_/status/1559886713534574593).

We have only seen the tweet, which includes a teaser video clip. 

We intentionally did _not_ seek out additional resources. You see, we have a view of what this game could be, and we want to hold on to that view.  No need to let the truth get in the way of that, right?  We can then imagine the fun Ramsay had while recording the sound bites.

Just let us have this one, OK?
