We've referenced the notion of a "hardware wallet" in several newsletters.  (Usually in the Scam O'Clock ™ segments, but who's counting?)  Having recently added a definition of that term to our [glossary of web3 terms](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/glossary), some sharp-eyed subscribers have asked: "this sounds great, but how do you actually _use_ one?"

It just so happens that we're writing a short wallet tutorial right now.  And we'll share it with you in next week's newsletter.  Stay tuned!
