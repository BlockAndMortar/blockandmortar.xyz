title: Putting those punks to work
---
A couple of weeks back, our segment [If you love JPEGs, set them free](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/expensive-code-free-jpegs-and-coffee-nfts#if-you-love-jpegs-set-them-free) covered some high-profile NFT artists releasing their work under the wide-ranging CC0 license.

In a slightly different vein, this week [Yuga Labs (home of the Bored Ape Yacht Club) announced the IP agreement for the popular CryptoPunks and Meebits collections](https://www.theblock.co/post/163519/cryptopunk-and-meebits-holders-can-now-use-their-nfts-for-commercial-projects):

> _CryptoPunk and Meebits holders have been waiting for this announcement since Yuga Labs first bought the collections from Larva Labs in March. The agreement confers full commercialisation rights to create projects and products based on a holder’s NFTs, putting them on par with the IP rights enjoyed by the Bored Ape Yacht Club’s holders, some of whom have already used the IP in projects._

In other words: people who have purchased CryptoPunks and Meebits NFTs now have the opportunity to put those assets to work.  (Technically, there are some wrinkles with US law as far as transfer of a copyright license … but we'll leave that one to the legal scholars out there.)  How soon till these JPEGs pay for themselves?  Will we get a CryptoPunks band that, to be ironic, performs music that is definitely not punk rock? And will we see a spike in phishing scams that target those collections?  

(No, we're not thinking of [Seth Green's BAYC-NFT-turned-sitcom-star getting kidnapped](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/money-in-money-out-and-a-little-hollyweb3#speedbumps-on-the-road-to-hollyweb3) a while back.  Why do you ask?)
