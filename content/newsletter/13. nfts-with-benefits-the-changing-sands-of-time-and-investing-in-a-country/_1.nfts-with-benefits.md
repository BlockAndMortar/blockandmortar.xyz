title: NFTs with benefits
---
When people think of NFTs, they probably think of deeds of ownership for digital artwork.  Those prices can move around a lot (sometimes [up](https://twitter.com/WatcherGuru/status/1547027094202228736), sometimes [way way up](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/what-the-hell-just-happened#at-least-something-went-up-in-price-this-week), sometimes [way way way down](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/14/twitter-nft-jack-dorsey-sina-estavi)). This space is mainly for art collectors and price-watching speculators. 

You also have the more practical use cases. Manufacturers and fashion houses, for example, have developed digital twins for real-world goods. And then there's our favorite, the utility-style tokens that serve as access passes or VIP membership cards.  We call that last group "NFTs with benefits" because those perks give customers reasons to hold onto the tokens, which should protect the resale value from the wild price swings of the purely-art-collection NFTs.

Issuing NFTs as access passes is known as _token-gating_ in the biz, and it's gaining traction.  Startup Front of House (FoH) has built a system to [pair digital collectibles with perks at brick-and-mortar restaurants](https://www.one37pm.com/nft/front-of-house-nfts). 

We've seen token-gating before. But FoH stands out as an early case of a company building out the backing infrastructure for this concept. (Remember, "companies building infrastructure" is akin to the old "[selling picks and shovels](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/supplying-tools-for-the-gold-rush-and-the-metaverse#picks-and-shovels)" concept: it's a hint that these providers see long-term benefit in this field.)  The other cases we've noticed appeared to be home-grown, one-off solutions. With FoH, restaurants don't have to build out their own.  They can just plug in to a provider's system.

We look forward to more NFTs with benefits, as well as service providers who will make it easier for businesses to work with token-gating and loyalty programs.
