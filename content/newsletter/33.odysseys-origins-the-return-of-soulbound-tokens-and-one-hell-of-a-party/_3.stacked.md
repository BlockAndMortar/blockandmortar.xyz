title: "Stacked"

"Use a hardware wallet to manage your crypto" is the kind of phrase that is simultaneously good advice and easier said than done.  Hardware wallets aren't always the most intuitive tools to use.  People new to crypto therefore skip that step, leaving themselves open to a variety of scams. (Please see the aforementioned People Whose BAYC NFTs Have Been Stolen.)

[Ledger, the company behind the eponymous hardware wallet, is releasing a new device](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/06/ledger-stax-new-crypto-wallet-designed-by-ipod-creator-tony-fadell.html) that should simplify crypto safety:


> _The Ledger Stax sports a black-and-white E-ink display, similar to that of Amazon’s Kindle e-readers. It also includes magnets, so that multiple devices can be stacked on top of each other, like a pile of books or cash — hence the name Stax. Users can connect it to their laptop through a USB cable or their phone via Bluetooth._

Based on the videos I've seen, the Stax looks sort of like a spiffed-up touchscreen iPod. I'm sure that's sheer coincidence, even though the Stax was designed by Tony Fadell. You know, the guy who designed the iPod.

I plan to revisit this story in a few months, after the Stax has been released into the wild.  By that point we'll also see whether the Ledger crew has received anything on legal letterhead from Cupertino.  (Or, in a more positive twist, maybe Apple will just buy Ledger outright?)
