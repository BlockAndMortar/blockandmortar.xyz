title: Things Are Currently Going Wrong™ 
---
We set a record, folks.  We had an entire issue of the Block & Mortar newsletter _without_ the Things Go Wrong™ headline.  But it's back.  

Sort of. 

If you've been following the news, you will no doubt have seen that the DeFi space is having … a moment.  The price of Bitcoin keeps falling.  The Celsius exchange has suddenly halted all withdrawals.  And there are some other stories in motion as we type this.

There's too much going on to provide you the clear, concise explanations you've come to expect from us.  So we plan to cover this in some detail in next week's newsletter.  Assuming the dust has settled by that point.
