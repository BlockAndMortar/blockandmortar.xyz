title: A quick  DAO update 
---
In [our previous newsletter](/newsletter/this-is-not-legal-advice-but-its-still-worth-a-read), we mentioned a couple of interesting papers on the legal issues surrounding DAOs. 

One link we forgot to include is [Paradigm's DAO Legal Entity Matrix](https://daos.paradigm.xyz/), which provides some details above and beyond the paper they published a couple weeks back. 

If you are exploring DAOs, the aforementioned papers and the Legal Entity Matrix are well worth your time.
