title: One way of exploring the space
---
The term "hackathon" sometimes gets a bad rap.  It conjures images ("memories?") of a flurry of energy, throwaway apps, and no lasting solutions.

While such hackathons have no doubt taken place, we don't condemn the entire practice.  A hackathon can just as well be an exercise in exploring a space, developing use cases, and quickly prototyping ideas.  Participants ask "is \[X\] possible?" and then give it a go. So long as you think "proof of concept" instead of "polished, robust, professional-grade apps and services," this pans out.

In the recent [Graph Hack 2022](https://thegraph.com/graph-hack/2022/) event, fifty-seven teams came together for three days to build prototype blockchain apps.  Nine of them split a $25,000 prize from event sponsor Polygon.  You can check out the [Polygon blog](https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-announces-winners-of-25000-in-graph-hack-awards/) for more info about the winners, which are grouped into the categories "Open Track," "DeFi," "NFT," and "Public Goods."  

If you're anything like us, you want to understand blockchain use cases and see what's possible. That's a good reason to review the Twitter thread by Graph Protocol director Eva Beylin, which [describes the apps in some detail](https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-announces-winners-of-25000-in-graph-hack-awards/).
