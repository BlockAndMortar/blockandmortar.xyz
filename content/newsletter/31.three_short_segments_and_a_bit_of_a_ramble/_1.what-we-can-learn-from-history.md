title: "What we can learn from history"

Risk is a fascinating subject. That's why I read Ed Harrison's work. He launched his solo website [Credit Writedowns](https://creditwritedowns.com) in time for the 2008 financial crisis, then created the Bloomberg newsletter The Everything Risk earlier this year.

[Last Tuesday, Harrison's newsletter explored the FTX meltdown through the lens of historical embezzlements](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-11-22/ftx-s-demise-shows-the-end-of-the-crypto-bust-is-near) and what this means for the wider crypto space. Frankly, it's one of the more even-keeled, dispassionate write-ups I've seen on this topic.

I won't spoil it for you. But I think you'll enjoy the read.
