title: "Well worth a listen: Bogdan Alexandrescu on The Defiant podcast"
---

Heading out for a nice autumn stroll? Trying to forget your uncle's political hot takes from Thanksgiving dinner? I have you covered for about an hour:

This week [The Defiant podcast hosted an interview with Bogdan Alexandrescu](https://thedefiant.io/more-accessible-web-3), co-founder and VP of engineering at [SAGA](https://www.saga.xyz). Alexandrescu's company makes tooling and infrastructure for web3 projects.

In this interview he explores the importance of developing free, decentralized infrastructure and his take on what counts as "web3."

(I am a little biased, because his views on what "the metaverse" means very closely align with mine. Hint: they're similar to my views on what "AI" means.)

Have you heard any interesting web3 podcast episodes lately? Any series you'd recommend? Let me know.
