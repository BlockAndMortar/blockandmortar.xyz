Many of you are still digging your way out of your post-holiday inbox. So I'm keeping the newsletter light this time around: three short segments and just one minor ramble.

(For readers who aren't based in the US: technically the holiday was just one day – last Thursday – but a lot of people mentally checked-out of the office earlier in the week. And then Thursday night was the start of our Season of Extreme Consumerism. If you're having trouble reaching your American counterparts, this is why.)
