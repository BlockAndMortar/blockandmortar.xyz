title: "This one's more of a visual"

Continuing [last week's session](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/paths-diverge-and-nikes-latest-move#this-is-not-legal-advice-but-still-a-very-good-idea) of What You Say When You Are Clearly Not Listening To Legal Counsel, [Sam Bankman-Fried has allegedly sent a letter to his former FTX teammates](https://www.theblock.co/post/189463/bankman-fried-explains-why-ftx-collapsed-in-new-letter-to-employees) in an attempt to explain how everything fell apart.

(Will this letter be a key plot point in the [various film adaptations of the SBF/FTX story](https://deadline.com/2022/11/russo-brothers-david-weil-ftx-crypto-scandal-series-amazon-1235181170/)? I can't wait to not watch those.)

Sam's letter feels a bitâ€¦ lacking in places. So Quartz's [Zachary M. Seward went on an extended rendition of the "there I fixed it for you" meme format](https://qz.com/edited-no-bs-version-of-sam-bankman-fried-ftx-memo-1849816240).

I won't quote any of it here. It's more of a visual.

I'll just say: *A+; no notes*.
