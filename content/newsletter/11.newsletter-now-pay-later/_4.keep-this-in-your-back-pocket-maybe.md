title: Keep this in your back pocket, maybe

We like to think that Block & Mortar presents a balanced view of what web3 has to offer.  We've told you about interesting use cases and crypto successes, sure. We've also brought you the recurring segment called _Things Go Wrong™_. 

Our hope is that, by reading this newsletter, you've learned more about the web3 space and have become more comfortable talking about it with friends and colleagues.  The downside is that you've probably found yourself on the receiving end of crypto-snark.  Knocking web3 is a safe default these days, because it's still early enough that no one knows just how far it will really go.  Rejections of e-commerce ("I can shop in the store") and cloud ("I don't trust someone else's datacenter") eventually dissipated, sure, but it took a while. 

Knowing that doesn't help much while your brother-in-law is roasting your crypto investments in front of the rest of the family.  So the crew at [Decrypt has released "Laminate This: What to Say to Crypto Haters"](https://decrypt.co/101448/laminate-this-what-to-say-to-crypto-haters) as your backup:

> _Next time an "expert" at a dinner party starts mansplaining why crypto is nothing but a scam for suckers, point them to these retorts. Print it out. Fold it up and put it in your wallet. Laminate it and use it as a placemat. Tuck them under windshield wipers at the bank._

To which we say: wait, people still go to dinner parties?  What's that like?
