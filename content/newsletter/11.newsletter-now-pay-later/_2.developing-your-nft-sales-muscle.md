title: Developing your NFT sales muscle
---
Releasing an NFT collection is akin to a startup's IPO: you need to raise public awareness and nurture interest in buying.  And while the first day's activity is no guarantee of future performance, it doesn't hurt to have a strong start.  So getting this right is a Big Deal™.

IPOs have a fairly standard template – shaped, in no small part, by banking norms and securities laws – but the NFT space is still finding its way.  Collections have learned to borrow techniques from the sales world, though, which is a good start.  Take the number of celebrity endorsements as an example.  And [Doodles recently took that to the next level in appointing Pharrell Williams as its Chief Brand Officer](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/renting-nfts-and-a-quick-trip-to-europe#so-much-more-than-your-typical-celebrity-endorsement).

Another important sales technique is to paint a future picture.  _"Today, this is just an empty lot; but in a few months, it could be your vibrant new store location."_  Notice how this is more emotional than practical, more storytelling rather than pure fact-sharing.  And a key element of good storytelling is… _anticipation._  You want your audience constantly asking: "OK, and what next?"  Eventually that belief in the (possible, imagined) future outcome leads them to exchange their cash for your product. 

This [Twitter thread reviews a number of high-profile NFT releases](https://twitter.com/NFT_GOD/status/1544321751403925505) and how they used anticipation, rather than utility, to build a buzz.  Remember [Goblintown](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/this-is-not-legal-advice-but-its-still-worth-a-read#welcome-to-goblintown)?  They offered some cryptic tweets and weird sounds.  That's it.  [Otherside](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/of-credit-cards-digital-land-and-real-money#otherside-land-grab)? Yuga Labs shared [a slick video](https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1505014986556551172) … that told you nothing about what to expect in their Otherside metaverse implementation.  Both releases saw very strong interest early on.  

Hell, the [Otherside debut even took down the Ethereum network](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/crypto-bahamas-otherside-fallout-and-a-little-crime-for-good-measure#traffic-jam-on-the-way-to-otherside).  If people were that eager to get their Otherside land plots, without any hard details about that virtual world would entail, it's safe to say that anticipation did its job.

Speaking of which, [Yuga Labs recently ran an Otherside demo](https://www.theblock.co/post/156146/yuga-labs-tech-demo-draws-thousands-of-otherside-land-holders) as a way of load-testing the system. The test didn't reveal any information about gameplay, but it did confirm that Otherside could handle roughly 2,500 concurrent users in a 3D world of spatial audio.  

Your Block & Mortar editors are seasoned technology professionals who have released a variety of real-world applications, so we understand the importance of this kind of testing.  This is the other side of anticipation: making sure the Otherside gameplay actually lives up to expectations.
