title: The crypto security arms race
---
The web3 world has no shortage of crime stories. Hackers [targeted the Instagram account and Discord server for the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/of-credit-cards-digital-land-and-real-money#more-things-go-wrong) in order to send tainted links to NFT holders. Seth Green [lost some NFTs to a phishing scam](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/money-in-money-out-and-a-little-hollyweb3#speedbumps-on-the-road-to-hollyweb3) (but later got them back).  Someone [made off with OpenSea's list of customer e-mail addresses](https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1542338816551243776), probably with the intent to target the NFT marketplace's customers for scams. And that's just from the past few weeks.

What makes crypto such fertile ground for thefts?  For one, there's the asymmetric payoff to the criminals.  Just compare "work 40+ hours a week in a typical job to earn a livable wage" to "spend a few hours scamming people for six-figure entries in a blockchain ledger."  You can make tons of money with this flavor of (important: _nonviolent_) crime. And unlike some high-paying careers, you'll actually have the time to enjoy spending it.

Two, there's the end-user side of things.  Crypto UI/UX is sorely lacking, which is doubly painful because managing token assets requires a lot of fiddly technical know-how.  It's easy to make mistakes because there are so few safeguards. And there's no official protocol for reversing a transaction. Mistakes are final.

Three, there's an arms race between the would-be thieves and their prospective victims.  Every time people sort out how to handle a scam, the criminals are poking around for the next weakness to exploit.  

(If this sounds like IT security, counterespionage, counterinsurgency, and every other "stop the bad guys" job, you're on the right track.  This is hard work, for which the sole reward is "you get to keep your belongings.")

All that is to say: while there's no 100% airtight guarantee of security in crypto, there are some general practices that should steer you clear of most trouble.  This Twitter thread by @samczsun [explores the architecture of a scam that someone tried to pull on him](https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1544186151585533952).  The first tweet drives home just how quickly the would-be thieves could have made off with his tokens:

> _1/ Today, someone tried to hack me with a crypto stealer, so I guess I've finally made it_
> 
> _Fortunately, they weren't successful, but all it would've taken was three clicks. Read on to learn about how the attack works, how to protect yourself, and some basic malware analysis🕵️_

The thread gets a bit technical on how to identify the malware. Certainly review that if you are so inclined. But the first few tweets, on how to avoid getting scammed, are required reading.  In short: pay close attention to any requests, and don't rush.
