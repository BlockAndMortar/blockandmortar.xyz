title: "Introducing: Tokenize This™"
---
Our mission at Block & Mortar is to surface practical business use cases for web3 technologies. The first phase is this newsletter, where we curate and analyze recent web3 happenings to help business leaders such as yourself understand what's out there.  

The next phase is for us to work closely with companies that are planning their journey into metaverse properties, crypto tokens, and NFTs.  We practice how we would help a company spot opportunities to unlock new revenue streams, become more efficient, or stave off risk.  And we affectionately refer to those practice runs, those [_Gedankenexperiments_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment)_,_ as Tokenize This™.  

This week we're sharing a scaled-down version of a recent Tokenize This™ session.  Someone asked us about applying crypto to their line of work, which led us to: what if your business were to _issue its own tokens as prepaid vouchers_ for blocks of time or fixed-fee services? How would you set this in motion?  What would be the pros and cons of taking this route?
