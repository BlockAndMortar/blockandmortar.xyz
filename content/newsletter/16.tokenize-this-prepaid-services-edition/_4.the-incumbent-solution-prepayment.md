title: "The incumbent solution: prepayment"
---
One existing, low-tech, tried-and-true solution is to offer prepayment.  Clients schedule fixed-fee services some weeks or months in advance, and they buy blocks of hours for upcoming time-and-materials work.  (Both approaches effectively amount to them applying a 100% deposit for upcoming work.)  Depending on your business, you may even wrap this up into a voucher that a client submits at the time of service. 

Prepayment usually requires additional terms around cancellation and rescheduling.  For example: 

*   Fixed-fee services: "We keep 75% of the fee if you cancel at least one month in advance; any later than that, and we keep everything."
    
*   Hourly services: "The prepaid hours are only good for some _N_ days into the future, after which any unused time expires."

By reordering the payment/work sequence, you also move the risk: instead of the client being on the hook to pay you later, you're now on the hook to deliver.  It's up to you to manage your calendar to account for any disruptions on your end.
