title: The motivation
---
Your current arrangement works, but there's room for improvement:

*   **You would like to fill gaps in your schedule.**  Sometimes a client needs to reschedule at the last minute.  Life happens, sure.  But each shuffle leads you to lose revenue because you suddenly find yourself sitting idle when you'd planned to work.
    

*   **Your clients would like certainty:** They want to control their spend (by locking in today's prices) and also guarantee your availability (so they can plan around the work you'll perform).
