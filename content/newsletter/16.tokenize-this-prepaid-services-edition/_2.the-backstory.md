title: The backstory

In a real-world situation, we would not start with the technology. We'd first work closely with your executive team to learn about the business model, goals, and challenges, then develop a comprehensive strategy around web3 tools and techniques.  And that would include a risk assessment to explore where things might break down. 

But since this is a quick newsletter read, let's assume that we've already developed your multiverse marketing strategy and mapped out a sweepstakes promotion that uses tokens as in-game currency.  Next on our list is the tokens-as-service-vouchers idea.

Let's say you run a services company, such as a tech consultancy, law firm, or auto repair shop.  You provide consultations and project work at a fixed fee, plus ad-hoc implementations on a time-and-materials basis.  Your "inventory" is time, divvied into the mix of fixed-fee and hourly-rate work you can perform each month.  So your proverbial warehouse is full of what economists call _perishable assets:_ you can't perform services in an hour that has passed, so any unused time has gone to waste.  (This is like empty seats on a flight: the airline can't sell them after the plane has taken off.)
