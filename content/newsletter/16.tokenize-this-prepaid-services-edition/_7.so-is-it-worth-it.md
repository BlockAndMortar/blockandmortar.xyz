title: So … is it worth it?
---
Let's remember that this was just a brief thought experiment. A deeper exploration, plus some road-testing, would expose even more gotchas than those we've listed above. 

But based on what we've already found, do we think that token-vouchers are a worthwhile solution?  

For now, and for our friend's company, we'd say no.  And we'd say the same for most small to mid-sized companies out there.

There will certainly be trailblazers who will map out the legal and accounting terrain, and whose equally adventurous clients will help them to road-test this idea.   And over time we expect that buying and selling crypto tokens will become more mainstream and therefore less of a hurdle for most sales prospects.

But for a business that doesn't want to be a pioneer, we'd stick to plain old, non-token-gated prepayment.

(We're still bullish on the promotional game with crypto tokens as prizes, though.  That has a different target market and represents a pretty strong return on investment.)
