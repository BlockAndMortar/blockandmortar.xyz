title: A crypto twist
---
What if you were to issue those prepaid service vouchers as crypto tokens?  That is, each token represents a digital twin of a service offering.  You mint one NFT, say, for each weekly Data Product Workshop on your calendar.  Or you mint (fungible) tokens that represent each hour you've set aside for time-and-materials work.  

So far, so good. But we don't apply crypto for crypto's sake.  We also need to ask: _what improvements does this offer over the incumbent solution?_

**Clients get the option to transfer (sell) those tokens to someone else.**  Because, hey, sometimes those funding rounds get delayed or a key executive has a family emergency.  It's possible that they'd have to sell those tokens at a discount in order to move the deal along, but they could write off the loss of ten or twenty percent of the token's value as the premium they paid to lock in your price and availability. 

**You, the service provider, get to capture some of that resale value on that secondary market.**  In the same way that artists can take a cut whenever someone resells their NFTs, you can collect some small percentage whenever the voucher changes hands.

And compared to paper vouchers, **the blockchain approach eliminates counterfeits.**  You can verify the provenance of those token-vouchers by tracing the purchase back to their date of issue.  And so long as you keep your wallet credentials safe, only you can generate new tokens.
