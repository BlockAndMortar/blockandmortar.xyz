title: Make it invisible by making it omnipresent
---
Just a quick note before we close out:

Last week we briefly touched on "[web3's disappearing act](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/the-other-side-of-web3-loyalty-programs-and-making-web3-disappear#web3s-disappearing-act)," the idea that companies would increase their use of the technology while also shielding end-users from the fiddly details.  Lowering the barrier to entry, so the plan goes, should improve adoption.

It's one thing for a company to do this, even if it's a large company like Starbucks or Chipotle.  Quite another [when a whole city does it](https://blockworks.co/you-can-now-buy-your-big-mac-with-crypto-in-lugano-switzerland/):

> _A memorandum of understanding was signed earlier this year between Lugano \[in Switzerland\] and Tether to integrate existing payment services with bitcoin and vetted stablecoins, Tether Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino said in a statement._
> 
> _\[...\]_
> 
> _Apart from onboarding merchants, the initiative wants to extend crypto payments to later include parking tickets, public services and student tuition. Residents of Lugano will also be allowed to pay taxes using cryptocurrencies._

(Don't let the article's headline fool you.  This is about so much more than McDonald's.)

We see this project, known in Lugano as Plan ₿, as simultaneously ambitious and necessary.  Ambitious, because it's an attempt at widespread adoption of cryptocurrency for everyday purposes.  (And [that hasn't always gone smoothly](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-bitcoin-travel-problems/).)  Necessary, because the best way to identify all of the wrinkles in such a system is to use it, at scale, across a variety of business entities. 

And hence, the twist on "making web3 invisible": Lugano's Plan ₿ will make sure that cryptocurrency is both everywhere and well-supported, so that people don't have to think about it.
