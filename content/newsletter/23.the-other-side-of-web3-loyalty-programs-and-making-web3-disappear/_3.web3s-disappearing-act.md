title: web3's disappearing act
---
Do you remember the early days of machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI)? Everyone was quick to brag about how much they were throwing this new technology into their products.  

These days you still see plenty of _"AI-powered!"_ claims in investor pitch decks, but companies have learned to dial back on that message in public.  Terms like "artificial intelligence" and "neural networks" conjure thoughts of semi-autonomous black boxes.  And that raises legitimate concerns about computers making decisions with insufficient compassion or human oversight.  

The corporate web3 world is learning fast from its older, emerging-tech sibling.  Universal Studios handles crypto wallet mechanics behind the scenes for its theme park visitors. Starbucks calls its loyalty program's NFTs "journey stamps." [Apple's Tim Cook prefers to talk AR and VR instead of saying "metaverse,"](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-avoids-term-metaverse-facebook-2022-10) while [Disney CEO Bob Chapek uses a homegrown term](https://www.theblock.co/post/172654/disney-hiring-transaction-lawyer-for-aggressive-nft-and-defi-plans-linkedin-post):

> _“We call it next-gen storytelling,” Chapek told Deadline backstage at the expo in Anaheim on Sept. 10. “We tend not to use the M word too often, because it has a lot of hair on it."_

We expect more companies to lead this double life, describing the tech in detail to colleagues and investors while not daring to utter its name in public.  ([Borrowing a hard-learned lesson from AI-driven insurer Lemonade](https://www.vox.com/recode/22455140/lemonade-insurance-ai-twitter), you have to be very careful about keeping those worlds separate.  But that's another story.)

Sure, these companies are trying to distance themselves from the seedier side of web3 that makes so many headlines.  They're also making the smart move of talking to customers about what matters to them.  If you have a fancy new loyalty program, website, or whatever, your customers are most interested in how that will make their lives better.  What's under the hood is, at best, a secondary concern.
