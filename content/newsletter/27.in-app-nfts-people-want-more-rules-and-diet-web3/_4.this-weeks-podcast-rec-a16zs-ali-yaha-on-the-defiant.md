title: "This week's podcast rec: a16z's Ali Yaha on The Defiant"
---
This week we stumbled across _The Defiant_ podcast's interview with Ali Yaha, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) .  We enjoyed it, and we think you will, too.
 
Yaha describes how the company chooses investments and how it supports its portfolio companies.  Of particular interest, around the 17:00 mark, he raises the point that a blockchain doesn't _run on_ a computer, but that a blockchain _is_ a computer. The hardware on which the code runs is irrelevant because the network itself is in control.  This drives home the point of decentralization and gives us a new way of looking at blockchain technology overall.
