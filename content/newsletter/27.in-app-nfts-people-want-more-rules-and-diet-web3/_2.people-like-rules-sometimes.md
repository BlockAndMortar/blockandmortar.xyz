title: People like rules.  Sometimes.

We've touched on web3 regulation in past newsletters ([#6](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/this-is-not-legal-advice-but-its-still-worth-a-read#this-is-not-legal-guidance-but-you-probably-want-to-read-it-anyway), [#10](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/renting-nfts-and-a-quick-trip-to-europe#eu-regulators-unveil-mica-and-tfr), [#17](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/two-loans-working-punks-and-canadian-clarity#canada-crypto-clarity), [#23](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/the-other-side-of-web3-loyalty-programs-and-making-web3-disappear#we-only-talk-about-daos-when-theres-trouble), to name a few) but we said it best in [#14](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/new-laws-for-digital-goods-and-keeping-track-of-web3-assets#tailor-made-laws): 

> _\[A lack of clarity about rules pushes people's\] behavior to the extremes.  The one involves the get-rich-quick charlatans innovators who try lots of money-making scams ventures while their activities are still not-yet-illegal.  The other is the group of folks who wait on the sidelines. They don't want to make any plans until they know precisely what's allowed._
> 
> _What separates those two is how they feel about a certain Possible Future Event, the one in which regulators declare the activities illegal and take the money away.  The innovators are willing to take the chance because, hey, maybe they_ **_don't_** _get punished and they walk away rich. The sidelines crew doesn't like all of those question marks on their balance sheet._

We're not the only ones who see it this way.  A recent [Bloomberg article points out that both retail and professional investors want more oversight of the crypto space](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-24/crypto-is-more-attractive-as-sec-gets-aggressive-investors-say). Which makes sense.  You never want today's successful trade to become tomorrow's subpoena.
