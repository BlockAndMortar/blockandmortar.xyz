The Vatican is the religious center of the Catholic world.  The [Vatican _Museums_](https://www.museivaticani.va/content/museivaticani/en.html) are home to an immense art collection of over 70,000 pieces.  The museum recently unveiled plans to [digitize some of the artwork and make it available as NFTs](https://nftevening.com/the-vatican-is-creating-an-official-nft-gallery/). The primary mission of the project does not appear motivated by profit; rather, its purpose is “to democratise art, making it more widely available to people worldwide regardless of their socio-economic and geographical limitations.”
