One complaint about crypto is that a token's price can experience wild swings.  That's where _stablecoins_ – tokens that maintain a fixed ratio of exchange, or _peg_, with some fiat currency – come into play. Many stablecoins are pegged to the US dollar, and usually in a one-to-one ratio.

Issuers of _fiat-backed_ stablecoins collateralize their tokens with actual deposits of dollars, or some near-equivalent, like government bonds.  For each dollar's worth of T-bills the issuers buy, for example, they mint one token of the stablecoin. Try to think of it like gift cards: you pay ten bucks and get a piece of plastic. You later hand in that card for ten dollars' worth of merchandise. The gift card is kind of a cash equivalent. 

Someone who issues an _algorithmic_ stablecoin, since they like excitement, backs their token with … pools of some _other_ crypto tokens.  What happens when the underlying tokens' price moves around, though? The issuer blends math and code to buy or sell those tokens (adding to or removing from the underlying pool) so that the stablecoin maintains its peg.  The stablecoin's price may diverge from its peg _just a little_ here or there, just quick jitter, but overall it's pretty much in lock-step with the fiat currency.

At least, that's how it's supposed to work.  And the whole reason we're explaining how it works … is so that we can talk about a case where it didn't work.
