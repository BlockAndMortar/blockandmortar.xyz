title: At least something went up in price this week
---
While plenty of people have had a rough few days, at least someone has experienced a win:

About two weeks ago, the Otherside metaverse land rush saw about $320 million in transactions. (Plus another $175 million in Ethereum gas fees, but let's not mention that.)  One Otherdeed has already sold for a very large multiple of its original price. Going from [about $6,000 to $1.5 million](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/145818/yuga-labs-otherdeed-virtual-land-nft-sells-for-record-1-5-million).  Not bad for two weeks of … holding onto an asset.

That said, this wasn't just _any_ Otherdeed.  It held a special potion.  And when it comes to NFT valuations, such special attributes lend themselves to higher prices.

But what does that potion do? And how will holding that potion improve the _in-game_ experience?  We're not sure, since Otherside parent company Yuga Labs has revealed very little of what their metaverse implementation will entail.  We'll have to wait and see.

One thing we do know: if the seller is based in Germany, they can properly report those crypto winnings to the government. The German finance ministry recently [released tax guidance on income made from crypto](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/11/germany-publishes-first-nationwide-tax-guide-for-crypto/).
