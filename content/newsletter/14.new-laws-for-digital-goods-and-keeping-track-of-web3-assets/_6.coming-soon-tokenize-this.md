title: "Coming soon: Tokenize This™"
---
(Because the name "tokenomics" was already taken…)

Longtime readers of this newsletter will note that Block & Mortar is on a quest to find practical use cases for web3.  We want to see how (and, sometimes, "whether") developing a metaverse strategy could improve an existing business model, or how adding a well-placed splash of cryptocurrency tokens could open up new opportunities.

On this journey we've come across a variety of implementations, such as:

*   payment rails (customers can exchange crypto tokens for everyday purchases)
    
*   new crypto coins issued for fundraising
    
*   coins and other assets used as collateral for loans
    
*   token-gating (requiring token ownership to access events and services)
    
*   and our favorite, one we call NFTs with Benefits (tokens with perks).    

We'll let you in on a secret.  In addition to reading about existing examples of web3 in business, we also explore potential use cases we _haven't_ seen in the news.  In these [_gedankenexperiments_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment)_,_ we imagine sitting down with a business owner – the same way we do in our other roles, with [Scott as a web developer](https://www.robbin.co/) and [Q as an ML/AI consultant](https://qethanm.cc/consulting/) – learning about their business model and their challenges, and figuring out where web3 technology could move the needle for them.

In the spirit of cryptocurrency tokens, we call the exercise Tokenize This™.  And starting next week, we'll share short versions of select Tokenize This™ explorations with you.  

[Please reach out](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/contact) to tell us what other industry verticals you'd like us to cover in this segment. 

Along those same lines, we also welcome any feedback you have on the newsletter.  Have a hot tip?  Interested in learning about a different area of web3?  Let us know!
