title: What's that word?
---
Part of the Block & Mortar mission is to make web3 more approachable.  As much as we stick to plain language, it's tough to write about NFTs and DeFi without using _some_ industry terminology now and then. Do we stop the action to explain each new and unfamiliar word? Or do we roll on and hope that readers will pick up on context clues? Neither path works, really.

That's why we're building our own [glossary of web3 terms](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/glossary), so we can link definitions of key terms in the middle of a topic.  Click the link to see what we mean by "[hot wallet](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/glossary/hot-wallet)," or keep reading if you're already familiar.  The best of both worlds.

And since the glossary is a living document, we can update it over time to reflect new industry realities.

Have you come across web3 terms that you'd like us to explain?  You can [contact us through our website](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/contact) to let us know!
