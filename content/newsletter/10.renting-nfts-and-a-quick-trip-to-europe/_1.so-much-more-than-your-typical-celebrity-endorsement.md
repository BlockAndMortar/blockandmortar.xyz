title: So much more than your typical celebrity endorsement
---
With all of [last week](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/nfts-sight-sound-and-smells)'s coverage of the [NFT.NYC](http://NFT.NYC) event, we didn't mention that the [Doodles collection has appointed Pharrell Williams as Chief Brand Officer](https://decrypt.co/103503/doodles-nfts-announces-pharrell-as-chief-brand-officer-fundraise-led-by-alexis-ohanian).  (Mostly because we were holding out for some additional details, which have just arrived.)

"Celebrity + NFT" is a common combination these days, sure. (Did we mention that Snoop and Eminem song?  [The one with their Bored Ape NFTs in the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjrA-slMoZ4)?)   So it would be easy for Williams to take this as your standard endorsement deal: _we do some photo-ops, you get to associate your brand with my name, we both get paid._  

But he's taking a more involved approach.  Like releasing "Doodles Records: Volume 1," an album inspired by the NFT collection.  And then tying that album back into the NFT ecosystem, with perks:

> _The Doodles album will be available to stream via various platforms, but will only be sold via NFTs. According to the representative, the Doodles album NFT will also be bundled with additional, as-yet-unspecified NFT collectibles._

The Doodles team is making the most of this publicity splash [to reveal the new Doodles 2 collection](https://nftevening.com/doodles-2-everything-about-the-new-doodles-nft-collection/).  Unlike the original collection, Doodles 2 is intended for a much wider audience.  And buyers can customize these NFT characters with wearables from the new Genesis Box set.  

Bonus: Remember how the [Otherside launch clogged the Ethereum network](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/crypto-bahamas-otherside-fallout-and-a-little-crime-for-good-measure#traffic-jam-on-the-way-to-otherside) and sent gas fees sky-high?  Gas for the Genesis Box ["bucket auction" only ran 23ETH](https://twitter.com/doodles/status/1542678590071853057).  This is already off to a good start.
