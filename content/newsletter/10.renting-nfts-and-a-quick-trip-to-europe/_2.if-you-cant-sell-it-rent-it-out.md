title: If you can't sell it … rent it out?
---
It's not just crypto tokens and DeFi platforms that are in a rough patch.  NFTs are also [seeing prices fall](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-29/nfts-have-fallen-off-the-cliff-as-sales-sink-to-lowest-in-year), and [celebrities have quietly swapped out those fancy profile pics](https://news.artnet.com/market/as-a-crypto-winter-descends-on-the-nft-world-celebrities-ditch-their-bored-ape-twitter-profile-pictures-213478) (PFPs) for, well, pretty much anything else. _What? A Bored Ape, you say? No no no, this old party photo has always been my PFP. Why do you ask?_

It may be tempting to sell off those NFTs and cash in before prices get any worse.  Doubly so, since a widespread rush to sell can bring additional downward price pressure.  And what if prices come back up?  Selling too soon means you're leaving money on the table.

Another option is to _rent_ the asset. You get to maintain ownership (so you can sell it for a higher value later, as market conditions improve) but still collect some revenue (as a consolation prize for not being able to sell right now). This may be modest revenue, sure.  But "modest" still beats "zero." 

A new Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) aims to make it easier for people to rent their (Ethereum-based) digital assets. [EIP-4907](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-4907.md), "Rental NFT, ERC-721 User And Expires Extension," 

> _\[...\] proposes an additional role (user) which can be granted to addresses, and a time where the role is automatically revoked (expires). The user role represents permission to "use" the NFT, but not the ability to transfer it or set users._

(FYI: [ERC-721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) defines NFTs.)

Beyond the [in-game assets](https://www.theblock.co/post/155242/new-ethereum-token-standard-paves-way-for-rentable-nfts) used as examples in EIP-4907, we see potential use cases for utility-based tokens such as access passes, membership cards, and loyalty club cards. These NFTs usually carry benefits beyond the pure bragging rights of ownership, so we imagine people will be eager to rent them out.

Say your NFT membership pass entitles you to a free meal every month in a particular restaurant.  You're out of town next month, so why let the asset sit idle?  You can loan it to someone who will actually be in town.  Keep in mind that this could also be a no-cost loan, say, so your spouse or kids could leverage your membership in your absence. 

(We also respect that some groups will not permit those loyalty club cards or access passes to be rented out, the same as they do with memberships that predate NFTs.  Expect them to check that user attribute and turn some people away at the proverbial door. And maybe issue those access passes as [soulbound tokens](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/money-in-money-out-and-a-little-hollyweb3#this-tokens-not-for-trading).)

There is no technical barrier to giving someone an NFT for a specified period of time; but ERC-4907 wraps it up in a clean framework.  And just like automated liquidation on DeFi exchanges (as compared to the old-school margin call by phone), ERP builds in the functionality to return the asset to the owner on the specified date.  You won't have to prod someone to return that loyalty card once you're back in town.

Your Block & Mortar editors are pretty excited about the prospects of utility-based, membership-style NFT use cases. So we see ERC-4907 as a step in the right direction.
