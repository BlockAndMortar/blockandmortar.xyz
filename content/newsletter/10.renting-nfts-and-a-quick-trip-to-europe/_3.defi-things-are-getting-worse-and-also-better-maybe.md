It's one thing for a single player in an industry to experience problems.  Quite another when the entire sector is under pressure.  That is pretty much the story of DeFi at the moment.

Sure, there was [the TerraUSD/Luna crash back in May](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/what-the-hell-just-happened), but everyone tried to pretend that was a one-off failure.  A month later, [Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and Celsius have fallen over](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/its-all-connected-and-thats-the-problem). And groups that (allegedly) had exposure to those two companies – including lenders [Genesis](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/29/genesis-faces-hundreds-of-millions-in-losses-as-3ac-exposure-swamps-crypto-lenders-sources/) and [Voyager](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/voyager-digital-suspends-trading-deposits-and-withdrawals-210843593.html) – are sweating.

All of this is to explain why BlockFi has been in the news this week.  [Crypto exchange FTX has extended a line of credit to BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/a-message-from-our-founders-july-2022), with the option to acquire the company.

Distressed buyouts can happen in any industry, sure.  And FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried – "SBF," to those in the know – has been on a shopping spree, buying up failing crypto companies.  What makes this stand out is _how_ SBF has approached these deals: he's conducting orderly liquidations of founders and investors in a way that preserves client funds.  

On the one hand, that can add some much-needed stability and continuity.  Clients are more likely to put money into crypto platforms if they feel that their funds are reasonably secure.  (That is: they know they'll only lose the money because of _their own_ bad bets, not because the platform goes under.)

On the other hand, despite all of the Twitter memes portraying him as some kind of ruthless gangster, the Possibility of Getting Bought Out by SBF would be a welcome outcome for some companies.  And it may therefore reduce incentives for good behavior, creating a form of moral hazard for crypto platform founders.

As always, time will tell.  Perhaps this latest round of DeFi shakeups will lead to a more stable industry down the road.
