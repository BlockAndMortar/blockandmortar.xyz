title: What we’re reading
---
We read a fair amount of articles, blog posts, and tweets to bring this newsletter to life.  (Side note: yes, after years of using Twitter to goof off, it's now … sort of … become part of our job? It's weird.)  And we typically use those links as starting points for segments, or as support for our micro-scale think-pieces.

This week we came across an article that we'd like to share outright.  Tim O'Reilly is the founder of O'Reilly Media, a company best known for its tech books with animals on the covers.  Tim is also the person who coined the term "web 2.0" to describe the post-Dot Com world that gave us social media and sites built on user-generated content.

Last week Tim published a piece called “[The Metaverse Is Not a Place](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-metaverse-is-not-a-place/),” in which he describes his take on the "metaverse" concept.  We find it a particularly thoughtful take on what a metaverse is and is not, and we think you'll enjoy it as well.

(Full disclosure: one of your Block & Mortar editors [is an O'Reilly author](https://www.oreilly.com/search/?query=author%3A%22Q.%20Ethan%20McCallum%22&extended_publisher_data=true&highlight=true&include_assessments=false&include_case_studies=true&include_courses=true&include_playlists=true&include_collections=true&include_notebooks=true&include_cloud_scenarios=true&include_sandboxes=true&include_scenarios=true&is_academic_institution_account=false&source=user&sort=relevance&facet_json=true&json_facets=true&page=0&include_facets=true&include_practice_exams=true) and [occasional contributor to O'Reilly Radar](https://www.oreilly.com/people/q-mccallum-2/), but we weren't compensated for sharing this article.  We just think it's cool.)
