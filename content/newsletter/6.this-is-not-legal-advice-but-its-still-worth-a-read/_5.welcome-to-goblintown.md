There's no shortage of people trying to cash in on NFTs.  With enough hype marketing behind it, any collection has a chance at becoming the next CryptoPunks or Bored Ape Yacht Club.  Maybe.

Releasing NFTs for free is one way to build a buzz, because early adopters don't take any risk in picking items from an unknown collection. (The backing smart contracts typically grant creators a portion of sale revenue each time the tokens trade on the secondary market, so even a "free" NFT can make the creator money over time.)  Creators therefore have an economic incentive to focus on volume of releases rather than quality.  Which is why expectations of free NFT projects can be a little … low.

All of this is to say that the mysterious Goblintown NFT release has exceeded expectations.  After just two weeks on the market, the average Goblintown NFT trades at 9ETH ($17k). [Rarer assets go for 69ETH ($136K)](https://luckytrader.com/nft/goblintownwtf/news/goblintown-1-1-sells-for-69-420-eth).  And the collection has attracted celebrity investors, including [Val Kilmer](https://twitter.com/KampKilmer/status/1531095911773851648).  Not bad for a project that began with a minimalist tweet  – "_ₘᵢₙₜ ₙₒw dₒwₙ dₒwₙ ₜₒ gₒbₗᵢₙ ₜₒwₙ_ [_goblintown.wtf_](http://goblintown.wtf)" –  and promised _“No roadmap. No Discord. No utility.”_

They should have added "No names" to that list.  The project clearly has some money behind it – the sound design alone is an indicator – so rumors abound.  Some claim it's Yuga Labs (the company behind Bored Ape Yacht Club) because they [once mentioned “Goblins” in their investment deck](https://twitter.com/dv0603/status/1532970531380572161). Others think it's Beeple, the artist who made NFT history when his collection sold for $69 million.  Some people hint that [it's both](https://twitter.com/GordonGoner/status/1533345073559134208).  

And the project continues to evolve.  Late last week, the goblins unveiled the interactive  [McGoblinBurger](https://goblintown.wtf/mcgoblin/) experience, where NFT holders can mint virtual burgers.  It's not clear what impact these burger NFTs will have.  Given that the goblins have been so tight-lipped about everything else, though, who knows when they'll tell us?
