title: This is not legal guidance (but you probably want to read it, anway)

So, DAOs can raise and spend money.  While that may look and quack like any other business entity, there's one key difference: DAOs are not, in the _legal_ sense, the same as the companies we encounter in the wild.  Your employer, your airline, and your florist are most likely _incorporated businesses_ with a structure such as an LLC.

One important feature of a formally-recognized corporate structure is _protecting the owners' assets in the event Things Go Wrong™_.  That's why the two Ls in "LLC" stand for "limited liability."  For the most part, US law still sees DAOs as a loose, ad-hoc collection of individuals. It treats DAO participants with far less protection than a company employee or a corporate officer.  (Except in the [State of Wyoming](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/crypto-daos-and-the-wyoming-frontier-9251606/). But that's another story.)  And that makes things ugly in a courtroom scenario. To quote a recent paper on the topic: 

> _Yet for all the innovation enabled by DAOs, in the real world coordination and commerce invariably run on top of the rails of “legal personhood.”  In order to easily engage with service providers like bankers, lawyers and consultants, as well as be able to pay taxes, DAOs need a legal wrapper endowing them with a legal identity.  Furthermore, a formal legal wrapper is often required in order to limit legal risks to members, and protect them from the liabilities or damages caused by the DAO or other members._

That's from ["Legal Wrappers and DAOs"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4123737) by [Chris Brummer](https://twitter.com/ChrisBrummerDr) (Georgetown University Law Center) and [Rodrigo Seira](https://twitter.com/RSSH273) (Paradigm).  It landed around the same time as Part II of  ["A Legal Framework for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations,"](https://a16zcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/dao-legal-framework-part-2.pdf) the series by [David Kerr](https://twitter.com/David_M_Kerr) (Cowrie LLC) and [Miles Jennings](https://twitter.com/milesjennings) (Andreessen Horowitz, aka a16z).

The tl;dr on both papers is that most DAOs, particularly those that hold assets or are revenue-generating  organizations, should also have some sort of legal corporation or partnership.  This protects both the DAO members and the people who do business with the DAO.  

While these papers do not constitute legal advice, they were co-authored by attorneys.  We recommend you read both – and then, find a crypto-savvy legal advisor – if you have any interest in forming a DAO.  ([The Brummer/Seira paper includes a handy diagram](https://twitter.com/ChrisBrummerDr/status/1531652515766362112/photo/1) to help guide your research.)
