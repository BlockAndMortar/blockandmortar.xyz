Block & Mortar issues [#3](https://newsletter.blockandmortar.xyz/archive/what-the-hell-just-happened/) and [#4](https://newsletter.blockandmortar.xyz/archive/more-luna-fallout-gamestop-and-tracking-cheese/) covered the TerraUSD/Luna meltdown and the ensuing fallout.  The latest plan offered by Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon has gotten the thumbs-up from the community though, understandably, there are [still some skeptics](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/148642/lido-finance-refuses-to-support-terras-new-blockchain).  (At least Luna 2.0 is actually backed by a running blockchain. [Unlike, say, OneCoin](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/manhattan-us-attorney-announces-charges-against-leaders-onecoin-multibillion-dollar).)

[Luna 2.0 is off to a rocky start](https://watcher.guru/news/luna-2-0-is-here-crashes-by-over-60-on-first-day), but it's only been up for about a week as of this writing.  Time will tell whether this reboot gains sufficient trust and trading activity.  Hopefully it won't appear in another _Things Go Wrong™_ segment of this newsletter.
