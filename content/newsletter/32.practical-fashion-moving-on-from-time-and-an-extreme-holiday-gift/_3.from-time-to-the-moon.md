Newsletter #13 included a segment on [Time's adoption of web3 technology](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/nfts-with-benefits-the-changing-sands-of-time-and-investing-in-a-country#the-transformation-of-time):

> *Time isn't just dipping their toes into web3. All of this is part of a larger strategy. Keith Grossman, Time's president, has done his homework on this space and is rethinking the company through a web3 lens. \[...\]*  
> *This is especially noteworthy in light of how slowly the print media field has adopted technology in the past. Remember early news websites, the ones that tried to simply recreate the print experience through a browser? Those publishers were running on the web but not really embracing what it could do for them.*
> 
> *For any exec who is thinking about how web3 could impact or outright transform their business, we recommend keeping an eye on Keith Grossman and his work on Time's journey.*

That was from late July. Last week, [Grossman announced his upcoming departure from Time in a Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/KeithGrossman/status/1597199228891455491). He will begin a new role at web3 infrastructure company MoonPay in January.

(If the name MoonPay sounds familiar, [you may remember their work on the Universal Studios NFT-based scavenger hunt from newsletter #22](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/of-loyalty-and-leadership-titles#web3-also-works-for-in-person-experiences). Or you've seen how they built [on-ramps for buying NFTs directly with credit cards](https://www.moonpay.com/business/nfts). They've also made news because of their self-service NFT minting platform, named HyperMint.)

If you have two hours to spare, [the last tweet in Grossman's thread links to the TIME Hall recording in which he goes into more detail](https://twitter.com/KeithGrossman/status/1597199255978274816).
