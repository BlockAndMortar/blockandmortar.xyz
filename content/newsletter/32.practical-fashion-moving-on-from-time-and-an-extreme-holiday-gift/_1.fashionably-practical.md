title: "Fashionably practical"

It seems that commercial NFT and metaverse efforts are plowing ahead in spite ("because?") of the cryptocurrency turmoil. Last week [Binance released its 2022 recap of institutional web3 adoption](https://research.binance.com/static/pdf/Institutional_Adoption_2022.pdf). Blockworks put out a [Twitter thread on clothing brands' metaverse adventures](https://twitter.com/Blockworks_/status/1598316516184887297). And [Timex has said that it'll launch a limited series of watches](https://www.theblock.co/post/191296/timex-to-create-limited-edition-bayc-watches-for-500-holders) tied to the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT group. (No word yet on whether the watches, like the NFTs themselves, will be the subject of theft and ridicule.)

Two stories stand out this week, both from the fashion industry. The first is that the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) is launching a series of metaverse shows. Several major labels will be there to present their NFT collections. (And yes, these are [NFTs With Benefits](https://www.blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/nfts-with-benefits-the-changing-sands-of-time-and-investing-in-a-country#nfts-with-benefits), designed to grant access to in-person events and the like.)

These shows move beyond simply recreating runway shows in 3D spaces. As [Vogue Business notes](https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/michael-kors-coach-and-more-head-to-the-metaverse-with-nft-launches):

> *A big part of the goal is also to educate American designers and creators on the possibilities that exist within this technology. It’s a move to introduce more high fashion players to metaverse and Web3 tech: not by looking at Web3 from a “fandom” community angle, but by offering experiences and assets that luxury fans would actually want to invest in. \[ … T\]he CFDA is aiming to reach true collectors who will value the in-person experiences and NFTs.*

The second story is about clothing chain and shopping mall staple Forever 21. It really began in early 2020. The onset of the pandemic closed a lot of retail operations and revenue came to a sudden stop. Unable to keep up with rent, [the company's landlord offered to buy them out](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/forever-21-reaches-deal-to-sell-its-retail-business-for-81-million.html).

And when I say "landlord," I mean real estate investment trust ([REIT](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp)) Simon Property Group. The "investment" part is key, because investors – the ones that survive, at least – are adept at spotting temporarily underpriced assets. (It's not as though F21 was failing because of poor business decisions. It was simply not prepared for the retail world to shut down overnight.) Simon saw an opportunity to buy a brand on the cheap and make money as in-person commerce rebounded. If it turns out they were right, you can call this a slow-motion arbitrage play to the tune of $81 million. Or maybe just a twist on the private equity playbook.

Bringing this story back to web3: F21, now safe from bankruptcy, [is releasing clothes for avatars inside its Roblox property](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-01/forever-21-s-roblox-metaverse-fashion-is-coming-to-a-store-near-you). _"They're getting into web3; who isn't?"_ Fair. But they're doing more than just dishing out NFTs. They're using this metaverse shop to road-test products:

> *Forever 21 is now bringing that beanie and other digital-first items to its stores and website in what it has called the first clothing line tested in the metaverse.*
> 
> *“We love the idea of testing products digitally,” said Jacob Hawkins, whose roles at Forever 21 include chief marketing officer. “It costs us so much less to test a product digitally than to test it in stores.”*

This makes a lot of sense. It's safer to get real-world feedback on bytes and pixels before revving up manufacturing and making room on shelves for tangible goods. This goes double for the fashion world, where purchase decisions involve far more emotion and individual tastes than something like automotive parts or business software.

Both CFDA and Forever 21 are spending the R&D money to experiment with web3 technologies. This is a great way to see how web3 can support their existing endeavors and unlock new opportunities.
