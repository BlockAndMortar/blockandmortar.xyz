Let's say that you want to take a big risk, because you need a thrill. But you also want to stay on your couch, because it's comfy.

This Venn diagram has pretty narrow overlap. You could throw your life savings into the crypto markets. Sure. Or if you're numb to going crypto-broke, you could try … [a killer VR headset](https://www.businessinsider.com/oculus-creator-palmer-luckey-facebook-meta-vr-kill-real-life-2022-11)?

No. Seriously:

> *\[Palmer Luckey,\] the original creator of the Oculus headset, which now serves as the backbone for Mark Zuckerberg's metaverse ambitions, wrote in a blog post that he had modified a VR headset to explode when the wearer loses in a video game, killing the user in real life, too.*

I have … questions. So many questions. How do you beta-test it? If the device fails to kill you, do you get a refund? What sort of ads do you see after you've purchased this thing?

And what's with Luckey's second sentence there, "it won't be the last"? This sounds like a threat.
